You are a research agent. Conduct research and experiment about the question: "Can large language models, without any chain of thought prompts, reveal reasoning paths and improve answer accuracy by altering its decoding approach?"

You have access to the following resources:

Model:
- mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1
- Huggingface token is provided in .env
- Inference functions via the provided utilities in /utils
- You should install necessary packages e.g. torch, transformers, datasets etc.

Datasets:
- GSM8K (grade school math word problems):
You can use the following code to load the dataset:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset("openai/gsm8k", "main")
```

Please design and execute experiments to investigate this research question. Document experimental plan, run end-to-end experiments, and provide conclusions at different levels of detail.

We encountered several difficulties during physical therapy on the acute ward. First, any change of position or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step. In this way, a position change to the 135\u00b0 prone position () took around 30 minutes. This approach was well tolerated and increased oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%. Second, we had to adapt the breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation. Accordingly, we instructed the patient to stop every deep breath before the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution. In this manner, the patient performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase his oxygen saturation. Third, the patient had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity. However, with close monitoring and frequent breaks, he managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation.

In the beginning, physical therapy focused on patient education about dyspnea-relieving positions, the importance of regular mobilization, and deep-breathing exercises. However, it quickly became evident that his anxiety from fear of dying and worries about his future aggravated his dyspnea and vice versa. The patient was so dyspneic, anxious, and weak that he was barely able to walk to the toilet. To counter this vicious circle, the physical therapist actively listened to the patient, explained why he was experiencing breathlessness, and tested suitable positions to relieve his dyspnea. He seemed to benefit from the education and the relaxing breathing exercises, as seen on day 2, when his respiratory rate could be reduced from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min and his oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen after guiding him through some deep-breathing exercises.

Despite repeated proning, gas exchange did not improve sufficiently and the patient was placed on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 7 days. After sedation was stopped, the patient continued to be somnolent and unable to communicate or to follow commands. Physical therapy therefore focused on perception training, movement exercises, airway-clearing techniques, dysphagia therapy, and mobilization. A first SOEB trial had to be discontinued due to hemodynamic instability. Instead, the patient was positioned in a side-edge position (), which he tolerated better and where an intensive exercise training including trunk and head control was conducted. Nevertheless, muscle tone and strength remained severely reduced, particularly on his hemiplegic side, and a second SOEB trial failed again. Physical therapy was also limited because of reduced self-activity and suspected impaired perception and visual acuity.

The patient was anuric at this time. Initial EKG showed normal sinus rhythm (NSR), nonspecific ST abnormalities, vent rate 73, QTC 471. The CT scan revealed an obstructing stone at the left proximal ureteropelvic junction (Figures , ) and at the right ureterovesical junction (Figure ), with resultant bilateral hydronephrosis (Figure ).\nWhile in the ED the patient progressively became hypotensive and was given broad-spectrum antibiotics, Vancomycin and Cefepime, due to concern for sepsis and aggressive fluid resuscitation was initiated. The patient did not respond to fluid resuscitation and was started initially on Levophed. In addition, the patient received 100 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate and 2 grams of calcium gluconate for severe metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. Due to the expected clinical decline, the patient was intubated in the emergency department. Critical Care, Nephrology, and Urology were consulted emergently in the ED. After initial stabilization, the patient was taken for immediate bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) placement by Interventional Radiology (IR) and placement of a trialysis catheter for initiation of hemodialysis afterward. Urinalysis from the PCN revealed hematuria, but no evidence of infection.\nAfter successful placement of bilateral PCN, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in critical condition. He was maintained on multiple vasopressors consisting of combinations of norepinephrine, vasopressin, epinephrine, and phenylephrine along with stress dose hydrocortisone. Repeat blood gas and labs revealed a worsening metabolic and lactic acidosis with a repeat pH of 6.7 and a lactic acid of 15.9. The patient was started on hemodialysis with a high bicarbonate dialysate for emergent clearance of hyperkalemia and refractory acidosis. After hemodialysis, the patient\u2019s pH was 7.1, despite a worsening lactic acidosis of 17.0 mmol/L. Overnight the patient was converted to continuous venous-venous hemodialysis, a form of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Within 24 hours the patient\u2019s acidemia corrected and blood pressure stabilized allowing for a de-escalation of vasopressors. A repeat chemistry revealed recovering renal function along with urine production in the nephrostomy tubes. On hospital day 3, the patient was successfully extubated, weaned off all vasopressors, and CRRT was stopped. Blood and urine cultures taken prior to dialysis were negative after five days. On hospital day 6, Urology performed a cystoscopy with bilateral ureteral stent placement and removal of bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. On hospital day 8, the patient had made a remarkable recovery from being critically ill. His creatinine was 1.5, BUN 27, and he was discharged home with urology follow-up in 1-2 weeks.", "age": [[55.0, "year"]], "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": {"26800971": 1, "27030462": 1, "24251430": 1, "26981442": 1, "25215151": 1, "25860205": 1, "22154632": 1, "22722338": 1, "26773926": 1, "32382466": 2, "31842973": 2, "25552792": 1, "22517736": 1, "31598437": 2, "34956761": 2}, "similar_patients": {"7202579-1": 1, "6916532-1": 1, "6777935-1": 1}}, {"patient_id": "17", "patient_uid": "8675571-1", "PMID": "34956751", "file_path": "comm/PMC008xxxxxx/PMC8675571.xml", "title": "De-novo Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis Following the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) Vaccine for COVID-19", "patient": "A 58-year-old Caucasian (American) male with an unremarkable past medical history presented for evaluation of nausea, vomiting, and a 30-pound weight loss over the past two months at our hospital.

Her medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease with three prior myocardial infarctions, recurrent cerebrovascular accidents requiring anticoagulation with warfarin, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and endometrial cancer status post radiation therapy. Fifteen months prior to the current presentation, the patient was noted to have a grade 1 endometrial adenoma but was not considered a good surgical candidate due to multiple comorbidities. Vaginal hysterectomy was considered but due to her long and narrow vagina, this option was deferred initially. Her only treatment option was radiation therapy and brachytherapy. She eventually underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy due to continued pelvic pain. The patient denied any prior history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Her bleeding was described as one large episode of bright red blood per rectum associated with blood clots. She denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or melena. The most recent colonoscopy was performed four months ago and revealed three diminutive polyps in the transverse colon with pathology confirming tubular adenoma.\nHer physical examination was significant for mild left-sided abdominal tenderness but was otherwise unremarkable. Rectal examination was notable for nonbleeding hemorrhoids and no visible blood. Blood work revealed white blood cells of 14.3k/uL (normal range 4.3-10.0 k/uL) and hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL (normal range 11.8-14.8 g/dL), which is similar to the patient\u2019s baseline. Creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.2 and blood urea nitrogen was elevated to 39. International normalized ratio was 2.0. Due the large volume of hematochezia and presence of anemia, the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed a large, fungating, friable, and ulcerated nonobstructing mass in the sigmoid colon. The mass was noncircumferential, measured 4 cm in length, and was located 15-19 cm from the anal verge (Figures , ). Biopsies were obtained with cold forceps for histology and the proximal and distal margins of the mass were tattooed. Histology showed invasive and moderately differentiated carcinoma without visible goblet cells. Given the patient\u2019s history of endometrial cancer, immunohistochemistry was performed and was consistent with an endometrial (endometrioid subtype) primary.\nPan-computed tomography was negative for any obvious distant disease.

Her symptoms were associated with seeing red spots and experiencing a burning sensation in the bottom of her feet. She was concerned because she was having difficulty picking up objects due to her hand symptoms. Her basic lab work was unremarkable, and she was provided gabapentin and magnesium oxide with close follow-up with her primary care physician. At follow-up, she complained of one to two months of unsteady gait as well as increased confusion. Her reported medications included losartan and metformin. Physical exam revealed normal pupils with reaction and accommodation (3mm diameter bilaterally), no cranial nerve deficits, normal strength throughout, and normal reflexes throughout except for diminished reflexes in the bilateral knees and ankles. She endorsed blurry vision; no ophthalmologic exam was performed, but she was able to read a name badge from one foot away. She additionally was found to have decreased vibratory and proprioception in a stocking pattern as well as a wide-based and unsteady gait.\nTo investigate further, tests for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), folate, B12, and rapid plasma regain (RPR) titer were ordered. Her TSH, folate, and B12 levels were within normal limits, but her RPR titer was reactive at 1:1. A subsequent reflex Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) test was reactive. She was told to go to the hospital for further workup and treatment. Further questioning revealed that she had had two sexual partners in her life, both ex-husbands. However, she noted that her husbands committed adultery several times and that she was not currently sexually active; her last sexual encounter occurred several years ago. She endorsed that she did not notice any ulcers or skin lesions, and she had not been treated for syphilis. During hospitalization, she received a lumbar puncture that revealed a negative venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test result. Her glucose level (61 mg/dL) and white blood cell level (3 x 109/L) were normal, but her CSF protein level was markedly elevated at 156 mg/dL. Due to her exposure history, a constellation of symptoms, RPR titer with positive TP-PA, and protein elevation in her CSF, our infectious disease colleagues believed that she contracted syphilis earlier in life from one of her husbands and was never treated. The decision was made to start treatment with intravenous (IV) penicillin (24 million units, continuous infusion) for two weeks. At follow-up, her vision had improved and she no longer had sensory symptoms in her hands. Her gait was somewhat improved, but still unsteady, and she still had burning pain in her feet.

The patient was a former smoker and denied any alcohol use.\nIn the emergency department, he was hemodynamically stable. Laboratory workup was significant for abnormally elevated liver function tests including aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) of 204/188 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 550 U/L, and total bilirubin of 2.5 mg/dL. Ultrasound of the abdomen was negative for any focal liver or gallbladder lesions. There was no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct dilation. Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan was normal, and hence cholecystitis was ruled out. CT abdomen and pelvis and CT angiography of the chest were negative for acute pathology.

Further laboratory evaluation for elevated liver enzymes, including viral hepatitis panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), iron panel, antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-mitochondrial antibody, alpha-1-antitrypsin antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and ceruloplasmin was negative.\nGiven that the patient has a history of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, the important differential diagnosis included leukemic infiltration of the liver and adverse reaction to the prior chemotherapy. However, the patient received only a short course of the chemotherapeutic regimen mogamulizumab (due to insurance issues), and hence it was unlikely to cause this current clinical picture. Subsequently, a percutaneous liver biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis, which showed replacement of the normal liver parenchymal cells by high-grade tumor cells with a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio (Figures -).

A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed in that hospital, showing a horseshoe kidney with severe left hydronephrosis and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, with the largest one located in the posterior part of the left renal artery measuring 4.7 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 2.6 cm. Additionally, there were multiple stones (Figures , , ). Urine culture was performed and revealed that various organisms were isolated (10-100,000 CFU/ml). Urinalysis showed a small amount of blood with a moderate presence of leukocytes and a trace protein.\nAt the end of 2020, the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI showed a horseshoe kidney with chronic hydronephrosis of the left kidney and a large mass within it centrally with further satellite lesions, which all likely represent UC and associated lymphadenopathy along the para-aortic chain (Figure ). Additionally, a finding of chronic pancreatitis was noted with dilated duct and stone, for which the patient was referred to the gastroenterology department. Furthermore, a bone scan and chest CT were performed, and no significant abnormality or metastasis was found.\nAfter a couple of days, the patient presented to the emergency department with non-radiating progressive lower abdominal and left colicky flank pain for three days with hematuria and constipation with fullness. The patient denied any history of fever or vomiting. There were no other genitourinary symptoms, scrotal pain, or change in the level of consciousness. Vital signs were measured and were as follows: blood pressure, 151/71 mmHg; heart rate, 109; respiratory rate, 20; and temperature, 37.1\u2103. The weight of the patient was 48.4 kg, and height was 166 cm. The chest was clear, while the abdomen was tender over the left side and the left flank area. Lab results were obtained (Table ). Urine culture was performed and showed more than 100,000 CFU/ml of Staphylococcus aureus being isolated. Abdomen and pelvis CT was performed to rule out any intra-abdominal collections, but it was negative. The urology team was consulted for his chief complaint, as his case is already known to them. On examination, they found that the abdomen was soft with lower left quadrant tenderness. They concluded that the pain was less likely to be from the left kidney as the CT findings were stable. Furthermore, based on the urine culture result, the patient was prescribed Bactrim and was given an appointment for admission a week later to perform a flexible ureteroscopy with biopsy.\nAfter one week, the patient underwent ureteroscopy with cytology and culture based on his MRI findings. Cystoscopy and retrograde pyelography showed normal bilateral ureters. However, the left kidney was severely dilated, and cloudy urine was noticed from the left ureteric orifice. Thus, culture and cytology were taken; then, a double-J (DJ) stent was inserted (Figure ). Urine culture was positive for S. aureus, and the patient was already on Bactrim. The urine cytology result was negative for high-grade UC, but benign urothelial cells, squamous cells, inflammatory cells, and red blood cells were present. Furthermore, since cancer could not be excluded, the patient was discharged and given an appointment for a left nephroureterectomy.\nAfter two weeks, the patient presented to the emergency room complaining of left flank pain for five days with hematuria and constipation. The urology team was again consulted and suspected urinary tract infection at the site of the double J stent. Thus, the patient was admitted, given antibiotics, and was planned for the open left radical nephroureterectomy the following day. The surgery was successfully performed, and samples were sent to the histopathology department.\nMacroscopic examination showed a fairly-circumscribed, bulging, gray-white mass located mainly in the renal pelvis and mostly replacing the entire kidney. It measured 14 cm in maximum dimension. The mass cut sections were homogenous with areas of necrosis, with a stent present (Figure ). The mass is away from margins and Gerota\u2019s fascia by 2 cm. The remaining kidney parenchyma showed dilated cystic spaces containing multiple brownstones. Furthermore, the resected left renal hilum lymph node measured 7 cm in maximum dimension. Microscopically, the tumor showed urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis with dysplasia in the background. In addition, the tumor had a predominance of sarcomatoid differentiation. Furthermore, foci of squamous formation containing keratin formation, and other foci of glands with mucinous and goblet cells lining were seen. The tumor was focally extending to the perinephric fat. Margins were negative; however, the ureteric margin showed dysplasia. The left renal hilum lymph node was positive for metastatic carcinoma. The final diagnosis based on the examination was UC of the renal pelvis with sarcomatoid differentiation (70%) and unusual histological differentiation including squamous (25%), and glandular (<5%) (Figure ). In addition, there was no outside pathology confirmation done. Immunohistochemistry profile was positive for CK7, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), vimentin, and focally for smooth muscle antigen (SMA). However, it was negative for desmin, cytokeratin (AE1/3), and GATA-3 (Figure ).\nAccording to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), the pathological stage is pT3N2Mx. After a couple of days, the patient underwent a cystourethrogram, and there was no leak. The patient was eventually discharged in good health the next day and was given an appointment. The plan of the oncology team was to start adjuvant chemotherapy and perform positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) for the suspicious distant lymphadenopathy. In addition, CT, cystoscopy, and urine cytology were supposed to be done regularly.

He described three to four similar events that occurred previously following episodes of extreme physical activity, however, all resolving. On presentation in 2016, visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. No fundus abnormalities were noted. Amsler grid testing revealed two scotomas about 1 and 4 degrees superior nasal to fixation in the right eye. Spectral-domain OCT imaging also revealed several hyperreflective bands in the middle retina of the right eye (Figure ). In Figure , the hyporeflective lesions seen at the border of the fovea inferior temporal and slightly further out were consistent with his subjective superior nasal scotomas on Amsler grid testing. Spectral-domain OCT findings of PAMM were corroborated with the Chief of the Retinal Service at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. The patient was diagnosed with findings consistent with PAMM. At that time, no treatment was given. While diagnostic measures were not taken during this patient\u2019s first few described episodes, it was thought that the previous episodes were also consistent with PAMM, given their similar presentation on the Amsler grid testing and symptomatology.\nIn mid-2018, the patient presented with a left-sided visual scotoma that had developed following a recent episode of febrile gastroenteritis. Treatment started with niacinamide OTC minerals, which helped initially over 30-40 minutes. After consulting with his cardiologist, nitroglycerin was prescribed but not taken. The patient was treated with 325 mg of aspirin and 200 mg of ibuprofen every 4 hours, with minimal relief. Aspirin and ibuprofen were administered because they are anti-inflammatory and blood thinners. The scotoma improved over the course of the next week but did not fully resolve. A permanent small scotoma remained.\nIn 2019, the patient began to experience similar symptoms after vigorous exercise. The patient was treated with 0.4 mg nitroglycerin sublingually previously prescribed by his cardiologist. Within 45 minutes, the visual scotoma improved, and within a few hours, it completely resolved.

She underwent computed tomography (CT) during the postoperative follow-up and was suspected of having an ovarian tumor (Figure ); thus, she visited our Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Transvaginal ultrasound showed a mass with abundant internal blood flow in the bladder mucosa (Figure ). Although the patient had no urinary tract symptoms, an examination by a urologist was deemed necessary. Accordingly, the patient was referred to the Department of Urology, and urinalysis and urine cytology were performed because early-stage bladder cancer was suspected. Urinalysis showed no hematuria, but urine cytology showed dysmorphic cells that were indicative of a tumor. Cystoscopy revealed a stalked papillary tumor at the apex of the posterior wall of the bladder. Transurethral resection of bladder tumor was performed the following month. A 2-cm papillary tumor was found at the apex of the bladder (Figure ), and the lesion was resected, followed by intravesical chemotherapy administration.

She had flaccid, hyporeflexic, pure motor quadriplegia with limbs showing only a subtle withdrawal flicker to pain. MRI of the brain revealed hyperintensity in the central pons in diffusion-weighted images (Figure ), T2-weighted images (Figure ), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images (Figure ) without abnormal contrast enhancement (Figure ), consistent with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) (Figure ).\nThe biochemical analysis showed hypernatremia while the remaining electrolytes were normal. The rest of the blood workup was unremarkable. Relatives denied an antecedent history of hyponatremia with rapid correction. The patient was started on sodium correction and was given five days intravenous (IV) pulse methylprednisolone 1 g/day to stabilize the blood-brain barrier.

Her initial vital signs were unremarkable. She was noted to have a pure motor flaccid symmetric quadriparesis with proximal more than distal weakness and generalized hyporeflexia. Clinical examination of other systems was normal. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) done on day three of onset of weakness demonstrated reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes of bilateral tibial and peroneal nerves with absent F waves and H reflexes. CMAP of tested nerves in upper limbs showed preserved amplitudes with normal distal latency and absent F waves. There were no conduction blocks. The sensory conduction study of all the tested nerves in all four limbs was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis did not show albumin-cytological dissociation. Therefore, acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) or hypokalemia-related electrophysiological abnormalities were considered. A basic metabolic panel revealed severe hypokalemia (potassium 2.2 mEq/L).

A thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that the malignant tumor on the left upper lobe was complicated by distal obstructive inflammation, the enlargement of the left hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and the multiple bone metastases on 25 August 2019 (Fig. A). Immunohistochemical (IHC) results of the posterior iliac bone marrow biopsy specimen showed the positive expression of CD3, CD20, CD34, CD235a, and NPO, and the negative CD61 expression. IHC results of an endoscopic biopsy specimen of the bronchial mucosa on the upper left lobe showed the positive expression of TTF1, CK7, NapsinA, Ki67, CK, and EMA, and the negative expression of CK5/6, P40, CgA, Syn, and CD45 on 6 September 2019. Histopathologic observations showed infiltration of atypia cells in mucosal and fibrous tissues. The detection tools of pathology and cytology included automatic IHC staining (BenchMark XT, Roche, The United States), digital slice scanner, image analysis software (Pannoramic 250, 3DHistech, Hungary), and microscope (Eclipse Ci-S, Nikon, Japan). Finally, the patient was diagnosed with stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma combing with bone metastases.\nTo seek potential therapeutic opportunities, the FFPE tissue and control sample (white blood cell) of the patient were detected using a 733-gene NGS panel in a College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certificated lab. Sequencing reads were mapped against the hg19/GRCh37 genome, and duplicate reads were removed, followed by variants calling in targeted regions using an in-house developed bioinformatics algorithm. The algorithm utilized a filtering model containing background error correction, strand bias, base quality, mapping quality, short tandem repeat regions, and low-quality mapping ratio 25 []. The NGS analysis results indicated that the patient had an EGFR exon 19 p.L747_S752del somatic mutation with an allelic fraction of 73.19% and TP53 p.H179L germline mutation. Besides, the whole chromosome 7 and 5q deletion were detected using NGS-based copy number variation (CNV) analyses (Fig. ), which were classical abnormalities associated with MDS. According to the clinical inquiry, the patient was a farmer by occupation, which means that he has long been exposed to certain chemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers, and solvents containing benzene. In addition, he smoked for 40 years. Taking all these findings together, we suspected the patient with secondary MDS. The results of the physiological blood indexes and the bone marrow aspiration test showed a decrease of platelet counts and the elevation of myelocyte counts. The proportion of blast was 5%, and the morphology of the cells presented the characteristics of MDS, which further confirmed our speculation (Fig. and Additional file : Fig. S1).\nIn terms of treatment, the EGFR-positive mutation patient was administered with gefitinib starting from 20 August 2019. Due to decreasing platelet counts, azacitidine was administrated for four courses of treatment. However, the thrombocytopenia had not been significantly improved, and the size of the maximal tumor in the lung lesion did not decrease after seven months\u2019 treatment (Fig. B). On 10 April 2020, a pathological report showed the infiltration of poorly differentiated cancer cells into the fibrous tissue. IHC results suggested the neuroendocrine tumor, in which small cell carcinoma and atypical carcinoid tumor accounted for about 40% and 60%, respectively. On 7 April and 28 April 2020, considering positive PD-L1 expression and high tumor mutation burden (TMB) in the tissue sample, the patient was administrated with toripalimab (a PD-1 inhibitor) and bevacizumab.

Her right hip was more painful than her left hip. There was no history of trauma, alcohol abuse, or steroid use. Her medical history included iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed 2 years earlier, after which she had been on iron supplements. She had no fracture episodes, including fragility fractures.\nHer height, body weight, and body mass index were 155 cm, 42 kg, and 18.7 kg/m2, respectively. She was able to walk for approximately 10 minutes without a stick, albeit at a slow speed. Limitations in the passive motion of her bilateral hip joint were observed thus: flexion, 100\u00b0, internal rotation 5\u00b0, external rotation 15\u00b0, and abduction 20\u00b0, on both sides. She was able to perform a straight-leg raise of the right limb with substantial pain. The neurovascular status of both lower extremities was intact. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system for the evaluation of hip-joint function (JOA hip score) was 46 points for her right hip and 56 points for her left hip. The score was based on a total of 100 points, comprising 40 for pain, 20 for range of motion, 20 for the ability to walk, and 20 for activities of daily living [].\nStandard radiographs of both hips (Fig. a\u2013c) demonstrated no characteristic findings such as the crescent sign, sclerotic band pattern, and collapse of the femoral head, and no joint space narrowing was seen in either femoral head. MRI of both hips (Fig. d, e) presented a low signal line in the subchondral region of the femoral head in the T1 weighted image and high signal region in almost all of the femoral head in the short tau inversion recovery (STIR). The oblique axial views of the proton density-weighted image showed a low-signal sinuous line in the anteromedial region of the femoral head (Fig. ). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) values were low in both femoral necks. Bone mineral density was 0.909 g/cm2 (T-score \u20130.9, Z-score \u22120.8) in the lumbar spine, 0.594 g/cm2 (T-score \u22121.8, Z-score \u22121.4) in the right femoral neck, and 0.529 g/cm2 (T-score \u22122.4, Z-score \u22122.0) in the left femoral neck. Laboratory findings were as follows: C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.03 mg/dl (normal range: 0\u20130.5 mg/dl); alkaline phosphatase 608 IU/l (40\u2013150 IU/l); calcium 9.0 mg/dl (8.4\u201310.2 mg/dl); albumin 4.4 g/d (3.9\u20134.9 g/d); and hemoglobin 9.7 g/dl (12\u201316 g/dl). Bone turnover markers were as follows: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b) 463 mU/dl (premenopausal normal range: 120\u2013420 mU/dl) and total procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (Total P1NP) 72.7 ng/ml (26.4\u201398.2 ng/ml). We diagnosed bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head and classified it as stage 1 in both femoral heads, according to the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification [].\nThe patient was instructed not to take as much weight as possible using sticks on the right side. Her symptoms improved immediately. However, 6 months later, her symptoms increased slightly without any traumatic episodes. Radiographic findings indicated almost no change (Fig. a\u2013c). However, a slight signal change in the medial subcapital region was observed in the MRI scan (Fig. d, e). Her pain gradually increased thereafter, and 10 months after her first visit, walking became difficult. The JOA hip score decreased to 34 points in both hips; still, no changes could be observed in the radiograph (Fig. a\u2013c). MRI of both hips showed a nondisplaced subcapital fracture on the medial side of both femoral necks, with bone marrow edema around the fracture (Fig. d, e). Because the cause of the fractures was not identified, the DEXA and bone turnover markers were measured again, and 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D was measured for the first time. All DEXA values decreased. The bone mineral density was 0.849 g/cm2 (T-score \u22121.5, Z-score \u22121.2) in the lumbar spine, 0.527 g/ cm2 (T-score \u22122.4, Z-score \u22122.1) in the right femoral neck, and 0.490 g/cm2 (T-score \u22122.7, Z-score \u22122.4) in the left femoral neck. TRACP-5b level increased to 607 mU/dl, and total P1NP decreased to 52.7 ng/ml. Her 25(OH) vitamin D level was 11.1 ng/dL and she was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. Based on the above results, our diagnosis was bilateral stress fracture of the femoral neck secondary to osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The patient underwent internal fixation of both hips with sliding hip screws (Dual SC screw system; Kisco, Kobe, Japan) to stabilize the stress fractures. In addition, the reaming performed before inserting of the sliding hip screw served as core decompression for the femoral heads [, ]. The specimens obtained from the reaming were examined histologically. Definitive findings of osteonecrosis such as bone marrow necrosis and loss of osteocyte nuclei in the femoral heads were observed (Fig. ). Postoperative radiographs showed no evidence of displacement of the fractures (Fig. ). We administered eldecalcitol 0.75 \u03bcg per day orally for vitamin D deficiency, and daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide acetate. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient began to bear weight as tolerated with the use of an assistive device bilaterally. One month postoperatively, she was able to walk without pain and used a cane part time. She eventually regained full walking ability without a cane 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, her JOA hip score improved to 90 points in both hip joints at 5 months after surgery. Radiographs showed no evidence of recurrent stress fracture in the femoral neck or progression of osteonecrosis (Fig. ).

Prior to the onset of these symptoms, he had been immobilized for several days following a minor sports injury.\nThe adolescent had no permanent medication and no prior medical history except for an asymptomatic ATD diagnosed at the age of six by functional antithrombin assay (antithrombin activity of 57%, age adapted reference: 77\u2013125%). Since at that time, there were no clinical signs of thrombosis, the diagnosis of ATD did not lead to any therapeutic consequences. Screening for ATD at this early age had been carried out on parental request, as his mother was diagnosed with ATD in her early adulthood. Interestingly, his mother now reported that she had very recently been diagnosed with IVCA (preexisting chromogenic test results showed an antithrombin activity of 50% for the mother, the age adjusted reference range being 80 to 130%).\nThe coexistence of other hereditary thrombophilic disorders in our patient and his mother (protein S deficiency, protein C deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin-mutation, antiphospholipid syndrome) was ruled out by respective laboratory analyses.\nLaboratory blood analysis in the emergency department showed markedly elevated D-dimers of 25 mg/l FEU (reference: < 0.5 mg/l FEU) and of C-reactive protein (CrP) of 184 mg/l (reference < 5 mg/l). Antithrombin activity on admission was reduced to 61% (age adjusted reference 83\u2013118%).\nA vascular ultrasound examination upon admission confirmed the clinically suspected thrombosis of the right lower extremity involving the external iliac, common and superficial femoral as well as the popliteal vein. The ultrasound examination of the left lower extremity veins did not give evidence of thromboses upon admission. The patient was treated with continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin at a therapeutical dose including several bolus administrations and antithrombin (4000 IE within the first 36 h) was substituted reaching levels in the target range between 80 and 100%. Subsequent monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) showed an insufficient response to heparin treatment (aPTT was 29 s before the administration of heparin and did not exceed a maximum value of 33.6 s during heparin treatment). The anticoagulative therapy was therefore switched to direct thrombin inhibition by argatroban at a dose of 1.5\u20132.0 \u03bcg/kg/min, which led to target aPTT values of 50\u201360s.\nDue to the elevated CrP levels and subfebrile temperatures, empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous cefuroxim was initiated.\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan on day three confirmed a complete DVT of the right lower extremity, and now additionally extended thromboses of the left lower extremity and thrombosis of both iliac vessels. Furthermore, it revealed an occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with prominent venous lumbar collaterals, suggestive of IVCA. Surrounding the lumbar vertebrae, several of these collaterals appeared to be fully thrombotic, which was confirmed by angiography (Fig. A).\nThe following day, a catheter-directed local thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at a daily dose of 0.25 mg/kg was initiated in both extremities and carried out for a total of 48 h. For the right leg, an additional ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis using the EKOS\u00ae system was performed.\nDuring hospitalization, the anticoagulative therapy was switched from argatroban to the vitamin K antagonist phenprocoumon with a target International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.0\u20132.5. Oral anticoagulation will most likely be continued lifelong due to the combination of extended multilocal thromboses with underlying ATD, as well as IVCA, which in itself is a risk factor for thrombosis.\nThe patient was discharged on day eight after hospital admission. An ultrasound examination upon discharge showed full recanalization of the femoral and iliac veins of both legs.\nDuring a routine follow-up 1 week later, the patient presented free of any clinical complaints. However, despite continued oral anticoagulation since hospital discharge, vascular ultrasound now revealed extended re-thrombosis of both the right and left pelvic axis and the right lower extremity, thus leading to a second hospital admission and re-induction of therapy with both intravenous antithrombin and catheter-directed thrombolysis.\nRecanalization of the right lower extremity and pelvic axis was subsequently achieved, whereby IVC occlusion was confirmed (Fig. B). However, the left pelvic vessels remained thrombotic even after 5 days of catheter-directed thrombolysis.\nSurprisingly, one of the angiographies allowed for location of the occluded area of the IVC by rendezvous-technique between the superior and inferior vena cava, which prior to this had been thought to be atretic (Fig. C). The vessel was successfully recanalized using balloon dilation and subsequent stenting (Fig. D).\nThroughout the clinical stay, the patient\u2019s oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon was intensified to a new target INR of 2.5\u20133.0 in order to prevent re-thrombosis.\nThe patient was discharged from hospital on day seven after admission. Regular follow-up examinations at our outpatient clinic did not give evidence for any new thrombotic events to date (time since first occurrence of thrombosis was 9 months).\nConcerning the thrombotic left iliac vessels, a follow-up angiographic intervention relying on special equipment was performed, but recanalization could not be achieved.\nFortunately, the IVC of the patient\u2019s mother could also be recanalized by angiographic intervention.", "age": [[14.0, "year"]], "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": {"12421140": 1, "30005274": 1, "10235441": 1, "24684277": 1, "31170948": 1, "27539155": 1, "30606158": 1, "18779442": 1, "34324211": 1, "24966143": 1, "18268431": 1, "19141163": 1, "31650242": 1, "25837307": 1, "25741868": 1, "26748602": 1, "30975910": 1, "25628315": 1, "34937572": 2}, "similar_patients": {}}, {"patient_id": "43", "patient_uid": "8693538-1", "PMID": "34956790", "file_path": "comm/PMC008xxxxxx/PMC8693538.xml", "title": "Management of an Unusual Central Nervous System Metastasis With Linear Accelerator Radiosurgery in a Low-Middle Income Country", "patient": "The patient is a 68-year-old retired male, born in Aloag and resident of Tambillo (a rural locality in the vicinity of the capital of Ecuador, Quito). His medical history was significant only for being a heavy smoker until 2016 (with a calculated 20 pack-year), copious alcohol consumption every 15 days until 2010 and a myocardial infarction in 2015, successfully treated with stenting, acetylsalicylic acid and atorvastatin, a medication that he continues until this day. There is no family history of cancer or other pathologies of interest.\nIn February 2020, he presented dysesthesias in the right hemithorax associated with pain and a mass-like sensation in the same region. This prompted a visit to his local healthcare center (part of the public health network) where a chest CT scan was ordered in March 2020 revealing a solitary pulmonary mass located in the right inferior lobule with an invasion of both the pleura and thoracic wall. However, due to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ecuador, all further studies were suspended for two to three months, resulting in a significant delay of the biopsy, which was undertaken on May 17, 2020. The histopathological study reported a neuroendocrine carcinoma. The patient was subjected to a thoracotomy and inferior pulmonary lobectomy on June 7, 2020 and was afterward treated with four cycles of chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and etoposide until November of the same year. In December, the patient presents with neurologic symptoms consisting of loss of balance, ataxic gait, headaches, and nausea, prompting the necessity of a brain MRI. The study revealed a mass on the right lobe of the cerebellum (2.66 x 2.61 x 2.48cm) with perilesional edema, compressing the fourth ventricle. A progression of his primary lung cancer was diagnosed, the original chemotherapy regimen was suspended and replaced with adjuvant Temozolomide maintenance therapy, and he is referred to the radiotherapy service for WBRT with 20 Gy divided into five fractions, which improved his symptoms.\nHowever, in March 2021, the patient comes to our hospital\u2019s radiotherapy department to request a second opinion due to the reappearance of his neurological symptoms (loss of balance, headaches, nausea, dizziness, and photophobia). The physical examination is relevant for a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, oriented in time, place, and person, incapacitating ataxic gait (the patient needs to be mobilized in a wheelchair), and severe photophobia requiring the constant use of sunglasses. The rest of the neurological examination is normal including cranial nerves, reflexes, and somatosensory function. Relevant prognostic indexes were calculated and included the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) of 80%, and the Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA), specific for patients with brain metastasis, of 3. A CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis was obtained, on February 22, 2021, in order to detect any new tumoral or metastatic activity; however, none was found (Figures -). Therefore, a follow-up MRI was ordered on February 23, 2021, which revealed two intra-axial lesions on the right cerebellar hemisphere and near the right lateral ventricle, respectively (Figures -).\nDue to the aforementioned clinical and imaging findings, radio-surgical management of the disease with 21Gy, in one fraction, delivered with a linear particle accelerator (LINAC), TrueBeam\u00ae (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was offered to the patient; immobilization was performed with a thermoplastic mask and Precise Bite mouthpiece (Solstice\u2122 SRS Immobilization System, Orange City, IA); treatment simulation was done on the CT images and volume definition was performed in the contrasted T1 MRI with SPACE sequence; Gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as the signal enhancing hyperintense tumoral regions observed on MRI and planning target volume (PTV) was prolonged 1mm in all directions. Dosimetric planning was based on HyperArc (Varian Medical System) which is a relatively new isocentric VMAT technique developed specifically for non-coplanar, multileaf collimator (MLC)-based stereotactic radiotherapy with automated treatment optimization and dose delivery; the clinical and dosimetric planning can be found in Figures -. Dosage and organ constraints, evaluation of the iso-dosage curve goals as well as the evaluation of the Paddick index were performed in accordance with published guidelines [,]. Before treatment, we administer a 16mg intramuscular deposit dexamethasone injection in order to reduce the risk of cerebellar tonsil herniation due to the important edema from the cerebellar metastasis. Tomographic images obtained with the Cone Beam CT system, integrated into the LINAC, showed a complete (100%) correlation of the images obtained during simulation and planning. Finally, the effective time of treatment was of four minutes.\nTreatment was delayed as per the patient\u2019s request for more time to consider and on April 5, 2021, the procedure was finally performed without complications and in an outpatient setting. A follow-up was programmed 15 days after treatment at which the patient presented significant clinical improvement (absence of headaches, nausea, dizziness, photophobia, and normal balance and gait). There was no evidence of radiation toxicity, and the cognitive function was normal. A control MRI on July 17, 2021, showed a clear reduction in the size of both lesions as well as complete resolution of the mass effect produced by the cerebellar mass; a comparison of the pre- and post-treatment scans can be found in Figures -.\nAt the moment, the patient remains in continuous follow-up, with the last reported telephonic follow-up, on September 2, 2021, in which the patient reported being asymptomatic and carrying out all of his regular day-to-day activities without any limitations.", "age": [[68.0, "year"]], "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": {"29307358": 1, "27903179": 1, "26272455": 1, "31355087": 2, "26848525": 1, "32073294": 1, "26541538": 1, "27365963": 1, "11463558": 1, "30732516": 1, "31096242": 1, "30107896": 1, "31601526": 1, "26898325": 1, "30991982": 1, "23174733": 1, "26801624": 1, "27040856": 1, "26041398": 1, "11286469": 1, "34956790": 2}, "similar_patients": {"6649918-1": 1}}, {"patient_id": "44", "patient_uid": "8693539-1", "PMID": "34956805", "file_path": "comm/PMC008xxxxxx/PMC8693539.xml", "title": "Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis Misdiagnosed As Generalized Anxiety Disorder: A Case Report", "patient": "A 68-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital on December 2, 2020, due to being \u201canxious and easily frightened for 3 months, psychomotor retardation, and affected by urinary incontinence for half a month.\u201d The patient had no mental illness before and developed symptoms 3 months before admission. These included waking up early, being nervous and afraid for no apparent reason, and being fearful of leaving the house. The patient was upset, sensitive, and cried occasionally. In addition, the patient needed walking support (e.g., hands on the wall) at home to prevent falling. The patient had been hospitalized at a local mental health center 2 months prior to the present admission, where she was diagnosed with \u201cGAD.\u201d She received paroxetine (20 mg/d), tandospirone (30 mg/d), and oxazepam (15 mg/d). Her symptoms improved, and so she was discharged. She reported that she took the medications regularly according to the instructions. However, half a month prior to admission at our hospital, the patient experienced a relapse characterized by anxiety, fear, small steps while walking, reluctance to come out of her home, speaking less, and being slow to respond, as well as urinary incontinence. In addition, her social skills declined significantly, and the patient could not take care of herself independently. The patient had been diagnosed with type-II diabetes 4 years previously. No other comorbidities were reported. The patient had no abnormalities in her personal history, menstrual history, marriage and childbirth history, or family history.\nPhysical examination after admission revealed she had normal limb muscle strength and tone. The finger-to-nose, rapid alternating movement, heel-to-shin tests, and Romberg\u2019s sign were normal. However, her gait was not stable and she took small steps. She was negative for pathological signs and meningeal irritation. In a psychological assessment, the patient exhibited clear consciousness, disorientation to place and time, passivity during interactions with few answers to questions, no hallucinations or delusions, a decline in memory and cognition; and a reduction in daily physical activities and energy levels. She felt distraught with a slight tremor in her hands.\nHer level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 6.280 \u00b5IU/mL (0.270-4.200); and she was normal for total T3, total T4, free T3, and free T4. Her level of anti-thyroglobulin antibody (anti-Tg) was 235.60 IU/mL (<115.00), and that of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO) was 238.70 IU/mL (<34.00). A color Doppler ultrasound showed diffused thyroid lesions with nodular changes (nodules in the right lobe of the thyroid). Both a CT examination (Figure ) and an MRI (Figure ) of the head showed brain atrophy and leukoaraiosis. A chest CT and pelvic ultrasonography were normal. EEG recordings revealed diffuse slow waves. No epileptic activity or extreme delta brush was observed. The patient\u2019s Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) score was 22, indicating moderate anxiety. Her Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score was 13, indicating a likelihood of depression. Her Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 14, indicating dementia.\nThe differential diagnosis was as follows: 1) rapidly progressive dementia, 2) type-II diabetes, and 3) subclinical hypothyroidism. After admission, the patient was treated with venlafaxine (75 mg/d) and oxazepam (15 mg/d). She showed a rapidly progressive decline in cognitive function, emotional dysregulation, paroxysmal body shaking, slow performance, abnormal gait, constipation, and urinary incontinence. However, the reason for the rapidly progressive dementia was unknown. Thus, lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid examination were performed with the following results: cerebrospinal fluid glucose: 6.30 mmol/L (2.50-4.50); protein: 0.87 g/L (0.15-0.45); and anti-glutamate receptor (NMDA) ratio: 1:3.2 (IgG).\nBased on these results, the diagnosis was changed to AE. Accordingly, the patient was transferred to the neurology department and treated with immunoglobulin (IVIG, 20 g/d via intravenous infusion for 5 days) and methylprednisolone (1000 mg/d via intravenous infusion for 3 days). The dosage of methylprednisolone was dropped by half every 3 days (till 48 mg/d) and was given orally. After treatment, the patient showed a gradual recovery in cognitive and emotional function, her body shaking disappeared, and her gait was stable. Her EEG was normal. Both medications were stopped gradually.

A worsening in the skin rash with exudate, pruritus, and a change to a violaceous colour, with scaly papules and vesicles (Figures , ) led to the performance of a skin biopsy which revealed (Figure ) orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis in the epidermis with areas of parakeratosis and, in the papillary dermis, there was an infiltrate of cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and reniform nuclei that showed positive CD1a and S100 proteins on the immunohistochemistry and negative CD163 (Figure ).\nThe patient denied constitutional, musculoskeletal, neurological, or urinary complaints. She underwent a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), thoracic-abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT), and bone scintigraphy.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine was done, which revealed osteophyte complexes at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6 vertebrae causing narrowing of neural foramina. Multiple T2-hyperintense lesions in lung parenchyma were an incidental finding. Upon further evaluation with positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan of the whole body, mass in the apex of the right lung, right hilum, mediastinal lymph node, soft tissue wall thickening in the proximal stomach along with multiple liver and bone metastases were found. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy revealed a proximal gastric growth from which a biopsy was taken. Histopathology showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A provisional diagnosis of carcinoma stomach with distant metastasis was reached. But immunohistochemistry came out to be positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and cytokeratin-7 (CK-7), while negative for cytokeratin 20 (CK-20) (Figures -).\nSo, a possibility of metastasis from a lung primary was considered. It was confirmed by a biopsy from the lung mass that revealed adenocarcinoma as the histopathology. On immunohistochemistry, it was positive for TTF-1 and CK-7 while negative for CK-20 and synaptophysin. Analysis for anaplastic lymphoma kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, and receptor tyrosine kinase 1 were all negative but programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) was 90%.

The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 26, suggesting a severe stroke. All other observations on admission were non-revealing, including vital signs, biochemical tests, and systems review.\nThe patient\u2019s neurological medical history included two previous transient ischemic attacks and suspected dementia. Other past medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, adult polycystic kidney disease, hypercholesterolemia, and aortic valve sclerosis.

Speech and language therapists noted that fatigue was limiting conversations, with the patient speaking with imprecise articulation and at a low volume. Occupational therapists concurred that the patient was poorly engaged during sessions, while physiotherapists classified this patient as having limited rehabilitation potential.\nStroke was finally confirmed upon a third head CT several days after admission, which showed bilateral thalamic infarcts. Other findings included hyperdensity at the basilar tip and left posterior cerebral artery, likely due to wall calcification of vessels. An MRI revealed bilateral hyperintensities in the thalami, consistent with acute bilateral thalamic stroke, with small left parietal cortical infarction (Figure ).\nImaging also confirmed the arterial location of the infarction, a single branch of the pre-communicating (P1) segment of the left posterior cerebral artery known as the artery of Percheron (AOP).

He complained of pain in his left ring finger, following an inadvertent injury with a spray gun containing Newton 103-S (a type of liquid cement). The patient had been wearing protective gloves at the time of injury. He had no past medical history, took no regular medications, and had no allergies.\nThe patient had been given tetanus immunisation by the referring hospital. He had a plastic surgery review approximately three hours post-injury. On examination, his left ring finger was swollen, erythematous with necrotic skin on the volar aspect of the finger (Figure ). There was no evidence of distal vascular compromise and the dorsal skin was well-perfused. He had a complete loss of sensation in the distribution of the ulnar digital nerve; however, the radial digital nerve was clinically intact. There was decreased range of movement at both the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) and distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ). The palmar skin was not involved.\nBlood results and observations were within normal ranges. No X-rays were taken at the time of presentation. Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics were commenced, and the patient was taken to theatre for urgent debridement and washout under general anaesthetic.\nThe initial surgical approach consisted of Bruner incisions. Significantly hardened concrete was identified in the subcutaneous tissues (Figure ). It was evident that skin and subcutaneous tissues were non-viable and were debrided, improving access. The pH of the wound was 8.5, in keeping with the alkaline substance injected; irrigation continued until pH returned to 7. The ulnar digital artery was thrombosed, but the radial digital artery was patent. The concrete had penetrated the flexor sheath, surrounding both flexor tendons. Subsequent flexor sheath washout from A1 to A5 confirmed that both tendons were in continuity but had undergone surface changes secondary to contact with the concrete.\nA second look was performed at 48 hours; the distal digit remained viable with the flexor tendons appearing healthy. Tendon glide was impeded by friction within the flexor sheath. Access incision was made into the palm, which revealed further cement material. The passive range of movement was reassessed, which confirmed PIPJ and DIPJ to be in good condition. Further debridement of devitalised soft tissue resulted in a large defect of almost the full length of the volar aspect of the ring finger exposing the intact flexor apparatus pulleys and tendons (Figure ).\nThe patient was counselled extensively regarding ongoing management, which principally consisted of either reconstruction of the volar soft tissue defect or potential amputation through the middle phalanx. He was counselled that the reconstructive option would result in a stiff and potentially insensate finger but could preserve length, while amputation might provide a faster recovery and better overall functional outcome. The patient opted for reconstruction and preservation of as much length of the digit as possible.\nAt one week from the initial injury, a cross-finger flap from the ipsilateral middle finger was performed, reconstructing the volar soft tissue defect (Figure ). The patient was discharged with oral antibiotics.\nAfter three weeks, the flap was divided and inset. However, the patient developed a wound infection five weeks after reconstruction, necessitating further washout and IV antibiotics.\nAt four months post-injury, the digit had an active range of movement of 20-84 degrees at the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ); both PIPJ and DIPJ were in fixed 30 degrees of flexion. The protective sensation was maintained in the radial aspect of the digit, and the patient did not develop issues with pain subsequently. He was followed up via telephone consultation at 18 months postoperatively, and he reported that he had no functional limitations on daily activities, and was back to work.

Furthermore, CT angiograms better captured a large, left-ventricular, IPA arising from a small perforation in the left SVA (). The adjacent left ventricle and interventricular septum were compressed. With CMR examination, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) clearly demonstrated the left-ventricular IPA with distal thrombus and a linear enhancement of the IPA wall, compatible with myocardial fibrosis ().\nSubsequently, the patient underwent surgery where the perforation was sutured and repaired, and the left aortic valve was lengthened with pericardial patches.

However, abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan found a circular and low-density lesion in the Segment 4 of the liver with unclear border, approximately 15 mm\u00d7 12 mm in size, which was mild progressive enhanced in the arterial phase and portal phase. HCC was suspected, but no hepatic cirrhosis and history of hepatitis (). Tumor markers, including CEA, CA199, CA125, AFP, were within normal range, hepatitis panel was negative, and hepatic function was normal.\nTo confirm the diagnosis, the patient underwent further examinations. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed one nodule in the segment 7, one nodule in the segment 5, and two nodules in the segment 4 of the liver (4, 6, 17, and 6 mm in diameter), respectively. The larger one was located in the segment 4 of liver, with hypointense on T1-weighted images (T1WI) and hyperintense on T2-weighted images (T2WI), which showed significant enhancement on the arterial phase and slight washout on the portal phase. In the delayed phase, the edge of the tumor was underscored as a circular enhancement which is unsimilar to the enhancement method of dynamic CT. It showed a significant restriction of diffusion on diffusion weighted images (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Other lesions in segments 7 and 5 showed the same hemodynamic characteristics as the tumor in segment 4 (). Based on MRI findings, it is considered as tumorous lesions of the liver.\nFor further differential diagnosis, the patient underwent positron emission tomography-computer tomography (PET-CT) examination, founding that the segment 4 of liver had a slightly low-density lesion with increased uptake of 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG), and SUVmax of early and delayed enhancement imaging was 4.81 and 5.24, respectively. The detention index was 8.9%. However, the lesions in segments 7 and 5 of the liver showed no significant increase in FDG uptake ().

The interfollicular area is dominated by small lymphocytes, and many plasma cells can be seen. In the lymphatic tissue, there were homogeneous red-stained collagen-like deposits around some small blood vessels.

EBV negative by qRT-PCR method (). A genetic study of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) clonality on the DNA of tumor tissues was performed using capillary electrophoresis method, which was reported previously (). The results showed that no clonal IgH gene rearrangement was detected: IGH (\u2212), IGK (\u2212), IGL (\u2212). Therefore, the possibility of extranodal marginal-zone lymphoma (MALT) was ruled out, and the final diagnosis was RLH.

Her depressive phases used to have a seasonal pattern, with autumn or winter worsening. When she came to our attention (November 2020), the current episode had been lasting for 3 months, according to her seasonal pattern. She reported low consumption of alcohol in social circumstances and sporadic use of cannabis in her adolescence.\nRegarding her ED, binging behaviors were reported to happen from the first diagnosis of depression, with various degrees of intensity and severity, and appeared to be more intense in depressive phases. Binge eating episodes during depressive phases used to be daily. No compensatory behaviors were ever observed. Notably, her first BED diagnosis was given in our center during her last depressive episode, as she had always been trying to hide her eating behaviors, even with physicians.

At presentation an erythroderma involving >90% of the integument was predominant (). Computer tomography (CT) scans showed enlarged axillary, inguinal and cervical lymph nodes. The complete blood counts showed a leukocytosis of 24,300/\u00b5l. Flow cytometry of the pb revealed 11,664 S\u00e9zary cells/\u00b5l with CD4+CD7- phenotype and with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 85.5. Flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate confirmed CD30 positivity with expression of 7% in S\u00e9zary cells. Polymerase chain reaction of pb confirmed the clonality in T-cell receptor beta and gamma showing monoclonal V\u03b2-\u03b22 and two clonal V\u03b31-8-J\u03b31.1 and 2.1 rearrangements. While conventional cytogenetics showed a normal male karyotype, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) detected the deletion of chromosome 17p in 22 of 200 interphases with deletion of TP53 gene. Immunohistochemistry of both trephine biopsy () and skin histology revealed infiltrations with S\u00e9zary cells (). The skin histology also confirmed CD30 positivity with 5-10%, and the diagnosis was revised to SS.\nThe diagnosis was thus revised to S\u00e9zary Syndrome in Stage IVA (pT4 Nx M0 B2) according to the updated classification of International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and the European Organization of Research and Treatment (EORTC) ().\nSubsequently, successive therapies with 3,000,000 IU interferon alpha three times weekly for 6 months, combined with 10 mg/m2 methotrexate (MTX) and 19 courses ECP including bexarotene showed no improvement.\nSix months prior to alloHSCT an antibody-conjugate treatment with brentuximab vedotin (BV) was administered. The patient received five courses, which led to an improvement of skin lesions and their reduction to about 30% of body surface. CT scans showed no further progression of the lymph nodes, the CD4:CD8 ratio was 76.7 with 63.5% S\u00e9zary cells in the flow-cytometry, confirming stable disease according to the EORTC and ISCL classification (, ).\nDue to preexisting comorbidities, we performed an alloHSCT from an unrelated HLA identical (10/10) and cytomegaly virus matched (recipient and donor IgG positive) 30 year old male donor with non-myeloablative conditioning (fludarabine 30 mg/m\u00b2 body surface area on d-4 to -2 and total body irradiation with 2 Gy on day -1) followed by infusion of pb stem cells (). Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine A from d-1 (blood target level 200 ng/ml) and mycophenolate mofetil (3x1000 mg per day). The patient received a total of 6.6x106 CD34+ cells/kg body weight, 1.1x108 CD3+ cells/kg body weight and 0.2x108 CD16+ cells/kg body weight. In the absence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), mycophenolate-mofetil was tapered 500 mg every 14 days from day 40 and discontinued on day 74 while cyclosporine A was tapered from day +56 and discontinued on d+196.\nThe restaging on day +30 and +90 after alloHSCT showed residual infiltration of SS cells in the FACS analysis of the bone marrow (13 and 5% of all WBC, respectively) and chimerism of 70 and 93% on sorted CD3+ cells. The CT scan on day +90 after alloHSCT confirmed the persistent lymphadenopathy. On day + 172 after alloHCT a complete hematological remission (CR) with no infiltration of SS in bone marrow trephine biopsy, 100% chimerism on sorted CD3 positive cells from bone marrow aspirate and normal pb CD4:CD 8 ratio was documented, thus confirming graft-vs-S\u00e9zary effect (). The CT scan showed no lymph node enlargements. The inspection of the skin revealed no suspect lesions.\nAfter discontinuation of immunosuppression the patient developed chronic GvHD of the ocular mucosa and the liver according to national institutes of health (NIH) criteria () on day 277 and required immunosuppressive treatment with intermediate dosage of methylprednisolone, cyclosporine A and mycophenolic acid. The immunosuppression could have been slowly tapered to 720 mg mycophenolic acid b.i.d, 5 mg prednisolone and autologous plasma eye drops as previously described (, ). Furthermore, since September 2021 ruxolitinib was added to the GvHD treatment ().

The boy also experienced difficulty in walking, blurring of vision, and fluctuating consciousness 1 month before admission. There was a significant (but unquantified) loss of weight and anorexia. He completed his bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination but missed all scheduled shots after his first birthday because of poor family support. On examination, a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9 was documented (E2V2M5) with left lateral strabismus. The pupils were unequal (4 mm/3 mm) and sluggish. Power in all four limbs was 4/5 (Medical Research Council scale) with normal reflexes. Babinski was downgoing, and Kernig's sign was not elicited.\nThe boy was transferred to our center for further evaluation and treatment. Non-contrast CT brain showed acute hydrocephalus with cerebral edema. Subsequently, an external ventricular drain was inserted. Intra-operatively, the opening pressure was high, and outflowing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed diffuse enhancing nodular leptomeningeal thickening, especially at the basal cisterns (). No intra-axial lesion was present. Small non-enhancing cystic lesions were seen along the leptomeningeal surface (), and no restricted diffusion was depicted. A diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was considered, and an extensive TB workup was undertaken. The positive results from that battery of tests were a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 90 mm/h and elevated CSF protein with normal CSF glucose levels. Otherwise, the Mantoux test was negative, and the blood, CSF, and CSF TB cultures showed no organism. The CSF for acid-fast bacilli as well as CSF GeneXpert were also negative. CSF latex agglutination was negative for streptococcus Group B, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, and escherichia coli. Both gastric lavage for acid fast bacilli stain and gastric lavage for GeneXpert were negative.\nSmear-negative TB was considered after reviewing the biochemical and imaging findings. Using the Composite Reference Standard (CRS) criteria, this child was classified as probable TB (). A standard anti-TB regimen was started consisting of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethionamide. Intravenous dexamethasone was prescribed during the first 2 weeks of admission and was subsequently changed to oral administration.\nThe boy's condition improved considerably after 14 days, and he was well enough to undergo a comprehensive ophthalmology examination. He had a visual acuity of 1/60 in the right eye, and there was no light perception in the left eye. A positive right afferent pupillary defect was detected. Ophthalmoscopy showed normal macula bilaterally.\nBoth his parents were screened and found to be negative for TB. He was discharged well after a 4-week hospital stay.\nOne month later, he presented again with vomiting, unsteady gait, and anorexia. The follow-up MR brain study revealed exuberant nodular leptomeningeal enhancement that was more extensive than the initial study (). Also, the previously seen cystic lesions have increased in size and number (). MR spectroscopy (single voxel placed at the thickened tentorium cerebelli) showed a markedly elevated choline:creatine ratio of 4.34 and absence of a singlet peak at 3.8 ppm (). A biopsy sample was obtained and sent for histopathological examination (HPE). Transcranial approach at the right Keen's point was used to obtain the biopsy sample. The patient incidentally needed a revision of his external ventricular shunt at that time, so dural tissue was obtained via the Burr hole just prior to the shunt revision.\nHistopathological examination (HPE) revealed a moderately cellular neoplastic proliferation with background desmoplastic and myxoid changes seen from the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain slides (). The cells were fairly monomorphic with mild nuclear pleomorphism displaying enlarged round to oval nuclei with fine chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli (). Occasional mitosis was seen (). The Ki-67 proliferation rate was high, accounting for about 80% (). Immunohistochemical (IHC) studies showed that the tumor cells were positive for S100 and synaptophysin ().

Comorbidities included hemochromatosis and a distant history of meningococcal meningitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain demonstrated a large right parietal lesion. Computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed left upper and lower lobe lung lesions, solitary liver lesion, and base of skull lesion. Histopathology confirmed BRAF/NRAS wild-type metastatic melanoma. He proceeded with resection of the right parietal lobe metastases in February followed by ipilimumab (3 mg/kg)/nivolumab (1 mg/kg) commencing in March ().\nMRI brain on the April 3 demonstrated intracranial recurrence with PET/CT confirming stable extracranial disease. A redo craniotomy was performed on April 8, complicated by the development of cerebral abscess and ventriculitis requiring burr hole and drainage. Cultures confirmed corynebacterium acnes and he commenced intravenous (IV) Cephalothin for a total of 12 weeks. Six weeks following his last dose of immunotherapy and while on IV antibiotics for his cerebral abscess, the patient developed severe peripheral edema, dyspnea, and tachycardia. Electrocardiograph (ECG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia, left axis deviation, and right bundle branch block. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a new circumferential pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade. Serial troponins remained normal, and cardiac MRI showed no evidence of myocarditis. A diagnosis of ICI-induced pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion was made. The patient was commenced on aggressive diuresis, colchicine 500 mcg daily and ibuprofen 500 mg three times daily. The active decision to withhold high-dose corticosteroids was made given the patient\u2019s concomitant cerebral abscess. He was monitored with weekly echocardiograms by the treating cardiologist with gradual resolution of the pericardial effusion over 4 weeks. Immunotherapy was discontinued. In June 2020, the patient had a further recurrence of brain metastases. A third resection followed by stereotactic radiosurgery to the cavity were completed at that time.\nSeven months following cessation of immunotherapy, the patient presented with sudden onset aphasia, left lower limb myoclonic jerks, and confusion. Further history revealed that the patient had developed subtle behavioral changes in the weeks prior. CT brain and angiogram showed no evidence of acute cerebrovascular event, infection, or intracranial disease progression. Laboratory results showed a normal CRP (0.7 m/L) and mild hyponatremia (129 mmol/L). An MRI brain revealed T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the right mesotemporal lobe with differentials including encephalitis or postictal changes (). Electroencephalogram (EEG) demonstrated lateralizing periodic discharges from the right temporal region. Empirical acyclovir was commenced following a lumbar puncture that demonstrated a mild elevation of protein 0.62 g/L, normal white cell count, negative bacterial/fungal cultures, and negative viral PCR panel. Despite up titration of antiepileptics, the patient continued to deteriorate with increasing confusion, fluctuating level of consciousness, persistent dysphasia, and development of visual hallucinations. Autoimmune encephalitis and antineuronal antibody panels were normal. ICI-induced encephalitis was considered the most likely diagnosis and methylprednisolone 500 mg IV/day was initiated, continued for 3 days, and followed by 2 days of 250 mg IV/day. There was a rapid and remarkable improvement in symptoms following steroid administration. A repeat EEG showed resolution of lateralizing periodic discharges from the right temporal region.

Clinical signs had developed during a local wave of COVID-19 approximately two weeks after the family of its owner had manifested symptoms of this viral disease and their positivity to SARS-CoV-2 had been confirmed by the local Health authority. Despite the dog\u2019s clinical condition, evaluation at our institution was postponed and performed only after two months from the occurrence of the aforementioned signs due to the COVID-19 illness and related quarantine of the owners. The dog had been previously evaluated by the primary veterinarian several times since he was a puppy, as regular examinations were performed approximately every six months. Previous medical history was unremarkable and no cardiac problems had been identified at earlier examinations. The patient was an indoor dog that was being fed a high-quality balanced commercial diet. He had no known exposure to toxic agents or medications and was current on vaccinations and parasite prevention.\nUpon presentation, cardiac auscultation revealed a grade II/VI left apical systolic murmur; the heart rate was 136 beats/min and the cardiac rhythm was regular. The femoral pulse was strong and synchronous with the heartbeat. Non-invasive systolic arterial blood pressure, assessed by a high-definition oscillometric device (petMAP graphic, Ramsey Medical, Inc., Tampa, USA), was 166 mmHg. Given the patient\u2019s anxiety during physical examination, the pressure value was primarily interpreted as situational hypertension. Respiratory rate was mildly accelerated (44 breaths/min), likely due to the dog\u2019s emotional stress, but lung auscultation was within normal limits. The remainder of the physical examination were unremarkable. Thoracic radiographs revealed mild generalised enlargement of the cardiac silhouette (vertebral heart scale 11.5, breed-specific reference interval 10.60 \u00b1 0.50 []), with no obvious lung parenchymal abnormalities (). Sinus rhythm was observed on a six-lead surface electrocardiogram (Cube ECG, Cardioline S.p.A., Caverano, Italy) (). A transthoracic echocardiography was also performed by a board-certified cardiologist (GR) using an ultrasound unit (iE33 ultrasound system, Philips Healthcare, Monza, Italy) equipped with phased-array transducers (3\u20138 and 1\u20135 MHz) and continuous electrocardiographic tracing (, ). This showed LV volume overload and global systolic dysfunction without concomitant left atrial dilation (). Although the mitral valve leaflets were structurally and functionally normal, a mild mitral regurgitation with central jet was present. In light of the aforesaid findings, the valve insufficiency was hypothesized to be functional and due to the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) phenotype. No other echocardiographic abnormalities were identified.\nResults of routine blood work, including complete blood count, serum chemistry and coagulation profile (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen and antithrombin), were unremarkable. In light of the DCM phenotype, further laboratory tests included a thyroid profile and assessment of the serum concentration of cardiac troponin I (cTnI, IMMULITE 20000, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The former test ruled out hypothyroidism as a possible cause of LV systolic dysfunction (thyroxine 29.5 nmol/L, hospital reference interval [HRI] 13\u201351 nmol/L; thyroid stimulating hormone 0.12 ng/mL, HRI 0.03\u20130.38 ng/mL), while the latter unveiled MI (0.19 ng/mL, HRI < 0.15 ng/mL) [,]. The dog was started on pimobendan (Vetmedin, Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim amRhein, Germany) at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg orally every 12 h, and several blood samples were collected with the aim of submitting them for investigation of infections responsible for MI. Initially, serological tests for Borrelia burgdorferi, Dirofilaria immitis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia canis, Leishmania infantum, Toxoplasma gondii and Bartonella henselae infection were performed (SNAP 4Dx, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, U.S.A.; MegaFLUO LEISH, Vetefarma S.r.l., Cuneo, Italy; MegaFLUO TOXOPLASMA Gondii, Vetefarma S.r.l., Cuneo, Italy; Indirect immunofluorescence performed as described by Fabbi et al. []), yielding negative results. Given the family history as well as the ongoing and still unexplained MI, further serum samples were subsequently submitted for SARS-CoV-2 investigation [,]. Different serological assays were performed (using samples collected on the same day) to detect antibodies against the S and the N proteins of SARS-CoV-2. More in detail, specific neutralizing antibodies against the receptor binding domain of the spike protein were determined in serum samples using the SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralisation test (sVNT, GenScript cPass\u2122 SARS-CoV-2 Neutralisation Antibody Detection Kit, GenScript Biotech Co., Ltd., Leiden, Netherlands) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (positivity: \u226530% inhibition). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay (VNT) was performed as described by Rijkers et al. [] (positivity: titers \u22651/10). Lastly, a commercial multispecies enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; EradikitTM COVID19-Multispecies, In3Diagnostic, Turin, Italy; positivity: >20%) was performed. Pending serological results, no other therapies were prescribed in addition to pimobendan, but exercise restriction was recommended. Within two weeks, results from serological assays became available. All tests yielded a positive result ().\nIn light of such findings, approximately two weeks from presentation, another control was performed to recheck the clinical, cardiological and serological condition of the dog, and to obtain nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 genome detection (using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting E gene, as previously described by Corman et al. []). The owner reported an improvement in exercise tolerance and no further syncopal episodes. Physical evaluation was unremarkable, with the only exception being the heart murmur, which maintained unchanged characteristics. Echocardiography demonstrated a mild improvement of LV systolic function, although a DCM phenotype and a functional mitral regurgitation were still present, thus explaining the persistence of the heart murmur (). Blood samples were collected to monitor the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as well as the serum concentration of cTnI. All serologic assays were still positive () and cTnI was still over the HRI (0.17 ng/mL). SARS-CoV-2 molecular analysis yielded a negative result. Therapy as well as instruction at home were unchanged, and another recheck was planned within three weeks.\nAt that control, although the clinical and echocardiographic findings were stable compared to the previous examination, and two serological tests were still positive (i.e., sVNT and VNT), cTnI was normalised (0.09 ng/mL) and ELISA yielded a negative result for SARS-CoV-2 ().

The herd adheres to the compulsory eradication plans for tuberculosis, brucellosis and bovine leucosis and to the voluntary eradication plan for BVDV. The PI animals are destined to be slaughtered. The PI calf was taken to the Veterinary Hospital of the Department of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Bari, Italy, for a diagnostic confirmation of BVDV PI and for clinical and hematological assessments to be shown to students of the Veterinary Medicine degree course. A week before arrival, the calf was clinically examined on the farm of origin and subjected to virological and bacteriological investigations. To this purpose, nasal swabs (NSs) collected from both nasal cavities with a dry sterile swab, a fecal swab (FS) collected directly from the rectum with a similar dry sterile swab and EDTA-treated blood and serum samples were collected to monitor the health of the calf and the concomitance of other viral and/or bacterial infections. In particular, NS, FS and EDTA-treated blood were tested in RT-qPCR for BCoV, BVDV, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis. The serum sample was tested for antibodies detection using the ELISA test (Svanovir\u00ae BVDV-Ab, Boehringer Ingelheim Svanova, Uppsala, Sweden) and the neutralization test for BVDV and BoHV-1, respectively. The collected samples were immediately transported on ice to the laboratory of Infectious Diseases of the Department of Veterinary Medicine of Bari (Italy) and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C (NS, FS) and at RT (blood samples) before processing.\nThe calf, which arrived on 12 April 2021 (T0), was immediately hospitalized in the Infection Diseases Unit of the Veterinary Hospital in a separate room and subjected to clinical examinations on the day of arrival and then two times a day during the entire period of hospitalization (Italian Ministry of Health authorization n. 0017484-DGSAF-MDS-P). To minimize the stress and discomfort, the calf was kept in a pen with straw bedding, was fed a commercial concentrate twice daily and had access to haylage and water ad libitum. The facility was closed for other animals and had restricted admission for people. A trained animal technician and a veterinarian monitored the calf at least two times a day. To enter the animal room area, the investigators undressed and put on work clothes and boots. The presence of the following clinical signs was noted down: rectal temperature, pain and depression, nasal discharge, polypnea, coughing and diarrhea. Two days after arrival (T1), the calf showed hyperthermia (39.8 \u00b0C) and, consequently, NS, FS, EDTA-treated blood and serum samples were collected to monitor its health status and to assess the presence of concomitant virological/bacteriological infections. The presence of BVDV was confirmed in the blood, NS and FS, and BCoV was contextually detected in the NS. As a consequence, stool samples, NSs, serum samples and EDTA-treated blood were collected weekly up to 60 days (T60) until BCoV test were negative.", "age": [[11.0, "month"]], "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": {"3017160": 1, "12757915": 1, "34262960": 1, "17112597": 1, "11811688": 1, "1719713": 1, "12770540": 1, "27296861": 1, "33972390": 1, "11376958": 1, "16626401": 1, "23137817": 1, "22315601": 1, "3912262": 1, "17564760": 1, "23804565": 1, "25428188": 1, "31118011": 1, "33203584": 1, "27070291": 1, "32681447": 1, "10076517": 1, "33869323": 1, "30264613": 1, "29780039": 1, "20619189": 1, "25180686": 1, "31817737": 1, "16881855": 1, "26689738": 1, "34944126": 2}, "similar_patients": {}}, {"patient_id": "70", "patient_uid": "8698328-1", "PMID": "34943247", "file_path": "comm/PMC008xxxxxx/PMC8698328.xml", "title": "Zero-Fluoroscopy Cardiac Ablation: Technology Is Moving Forward in Complex Procedures\u2014A Novel Workflow for Atrial Fibrillation", "patient": "The first patient is a 53-year-old male with a long history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He had some cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure that had been well controlled for 5 years on a therapy with ACE inhibitor. He did not suffer from other relevant comorbidities, except for sleep apnea syndrome on home nocturnal ventilatory support. He had his first episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation six years before and he started oral anticoagulation with dabigatran (CHA2DS2-VASC score 1) and antiarrhythmic therapy, initially with Flecainide and then with Amiodarone. Despite this, he had been admitted several times to the emergency room due to irregular heartbeat episodes and other symptoms, such as palpitations and shortness of breath. The arrhythmic recurrences often required electrical or pharmacological cardioversions to control the symptoms. The patient was then referred to our clinic because of the gradual worsening of his symptoms. The arrhythmic episodes lasted several hours, with spontaneous resolution, crippling him in his daily life. Considering his young age, the absence of cardiac structural alterations, and the inefficacy of the rhythm control strategy, AF ablation was proposed to the patient. At admission into the ward, the patient was overweight (body mass index was 38 kg/m2) and the electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm, while the pre-procedure echocardiography revealed dilated left atrium (left atrial volume 43 mL/m2) and the ejection fraction of the left ventricle of 55%.\nWe started the procedure by performing a bipolar map of the right atrium with a ThermoCool SmartTouch\u2122 SF (Biosense Webster, Johnson & Johnson Medical S.p.a., Irvine, CA, USA) ablation catheter. First, we delineated the inferior and superior vena cava, and the coronary sinus, and we tagged in yellow the His potential (A). Next, we carefully reconstructed the interatrial septum and, finally, to precisely define the fossa ovalis (FO), we set the color range on the bipolar map to 0.25\u20130.75 mV and we tagged in light blue all the fragmented and low voltage signals, which are typical of the FO area [] (A). The FO location was further confirmed by the ICE and the CartoSound\u00ae module (Biosense Webster, Johnson & Johnson Medical S.p.a., Irvine, CA, USA). A 10F Soundstar\u2122 Ultrasound catheter was advanced in the right atrium and pointed at the FO. Thanks to the CartoSound\u00ae module, it was possible to mark the contours of the FO location and to visualize them on the 3D EAM previously obtained (B). In addition to the FO, using ICE and the CartoSound\u00ae module, it was possible to assess and to reconstruct the structures of the left atrium (left atrial appendage, pulmonary veins, and esophagus). Next, a single transseptal puncture was performed using the bidirectional guiding sheath VIZIGO\u2122 (8.5F) and a transseptal needle (standard Brockenbrough needle 98 cm from Abbott, St. Paul, MN, USA). Since the sheath is visible on the Carto 3\u00ae EAM system, it was possible to place it in the superior vena cava (3 to 4 cm above the cavoatrial junction) without any use of fluoroscopy. At this point, the guidewire was removed and the transseptal needle with the stylet was gently inserted and advanced through VIZIGO\u2122, avoiding pushing the needle over the tip of the sheath. In this step, the needle and the sheath were held in the fingers between 4 and 6 o\u2019clock. The needle and the sheath were pulled back caudally, visualizing the VIZIGO\u2122 sheath with the 3D EAM system until it reached the level of the coronary sinus and the tip of the dilator inside the sheath placed in the FO. From this location, the VIZIGO\u2122 sheath was pushed and placed on the FO under the guidance of the EAM system and confirmed by ICE imaging (C). When the sheath was in the right position, the transseptal needle was advanced to perform the puncture. Live tracking of the distal part of the needle on the 3D EAM system was possible thanks to an Alligator clip lead wires (FIAB Spa, Florence, Italy) connected to the distal portion of the needle (see ). Both the transseptal sheath and the needle should be advanced for 1\u20132 cm in the left atrium (LA). Then, holding the needle, the sheath was advanced over the needle. Finally, the needle and the dilator were kept steady, and the sheath was advanced over the dilator. The transseptal sheath was deaired and a 0.032 inch guidewire was advanced toward the left superior pulmonary vein under ICE guidance.\nAfter a successful transseptal puncture, the ThermoCool SmartTouch\u2122 SF catheter was advanced through the VIZIGO\u2122 sheath into the left atrium to perform a fast anatomical mapping and PVI following the CLOSE protocol []. With the help of the VIZIGO\u2122 steerable sheath, we performed ablations with good contact and stability, leading to fast and effective PVI. There were no complications during the entire procedure. The procedure time was 100 min, radiofrequency time was 20 min, and, finally, the fluoroscopy time was 00:00 min:s. The patient was followed up 3 months after the procedure with an outpatient visit and electrocardiographic-Holter monitoring, which did not register any AF episode. After a 9 months follow-up, the patient presents no more symptoms, is not taking any antiarrhythmic drugs, and does not have recurrences of AF.

He had arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus under good pharmacological control. He also had microcythemia due to a thalassemic trait. The atrial fibrillation was discovered seven years earlier with an electrocardiogram performed during a routine medical examination. The patient was asymptomatic for palpitations, irregular heartbeat, or other cardiological symptoms. An echocardiogram was performed without showing any pathological feature and oral anticoagulation with Dabigatran (CHA2DS2-VASC score 2) was started. After four weeks of therapy, electrical cardioversion was performed with effectiveness in restoring sinus rhythm. An antiarrhythmic therapy with Flecainide 100 mg twice daily was also initiated. The patient did not undergo further medical checks during the following five years, when, during a cardiological visit, the recurrence of the arrhythmia was discovered. The patient mentioned reduction in daily normal activity due to asthenia. An echocardiography exam showed a left atrial indexed volume of 36 mL/m2 and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 47%. AF ablation through PVI was proposed. At admission, the electrocardiogram showed AF. To perform an accurate anatomical reconstruction of the right and left atrium and a high-density voltage map, the multi-electrode mapping (MEM) catheter Pentaray\u2122 (Biosense Webster, Johnson & Johnson Medical S.p.a., Irvine, CA, USA) was used. As in the previous case, we started by mapping the right atrium to define the inferior and superior vena cava, the His location, and the coronary sinus (A). Next, a decapolar catheter was inserted in the coronary sinus under 3D EAM guidance. Again, we mapped the FO looking for fragmented and low-voltage signals. However, this time, using the Pentaray\u2122 catheter, we were able to achieve a higher signal resolution and to easily discriminate between a low-voltage and fragmented signal area, although the patient was in AF. Moreover, using the Pentaray\u2122 catheter, we were able to acquire a detailed map in a shorter time (5 min with Pentaray\u2122 catheter vs. 10 min with Thermocool SmartTouch\u2122 SF catheter in the previous case). Again, based on the 3D EAM and under ICE guidance, a single transseptal puncture was performed with the VIZIGO\u2122 sheath and the transseptal needle, both visible on the 3D EAM system (B,C). The transseptal puncture procedure followed the same steps already described in the previous case (video of the puncture is available in the ). The Pentaray\u2122 catheter was then advanced in the left atrium through the VIZIGO\u2122 sheath and a detailed fast anatomical mapping of the chamber and the veins was obtained (). The VIZIGO\u2122 steerable sheath was extremely useful to map all the left atrium structures and veins very quickly. Moreover, using ICE imaging and the CartoSound\u00ae module, we could identify important structures, such as the pulmonary veins (A) and the esophagus (B), and to co-register the ultrasound images with the fast anatomical map obtained with CARTO 3\u00ae. The Pentaray\u2122 catheter was then replaced by the ThermoCool SmartTouch\u2122 SF catheter to perform PVI following the CLOSE protocol []. Again, with the help of the VIZIGO\u2122 steerable sheath, we performed ablations with good contact and stability, leading to a fast and effective PVI. As in the previous case, the entire procedure was performed without fluoroscopy and without complications (procedural time was 110 min, radiofrequency time was 19 min, and fluoroscopy time was 00:00 min:s). The patient was followed up 3 months after the procedure with an outpatient visit, echocardiogram, and electrocardiographic-Holter monitoring, which did not register any AF episode. The echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (65%) and the patient mentioned that there was not a reduction in normal daily activities.

Persistent symptoms started at home 4 days before and he assumed clarithromycin as empiric antibiotic therapy. The physical examination showed jaundice, dry mucous membranes, pharyngeal hyperemia in the tonsillar region and soft palate, and left laterocervical lymphadenopathy. He was tachypneic (respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute) and the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) in room air was 92%. The abdominal palpation revealed hepatosplenomegaly. The laboratory tests showed a white blood count (WBC) of 8000 cells/mcL with 74% neutrophils, thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 31,000/mcL), total bilirubin 5.8 mg/dL, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) 43 mg/L, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, AST 150 UI/L, ALT 79 UI/L. The nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative (RT-PCR). Blood cultures were carried out upon admission and a full-body computer tomography (CT) was performed on the second day of hospitalization. The CT showed ground glass bilateral pulmonary alterations, pericardial effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly ().\nThe neck CT scan with intravenous contrast evidenced a 5.4 cm retropharyngeal abscess with associated thrombosis of the left anterior jugular vein ().\nOn the second day of hospitalization, the microbiology laboratory communicated the early identification of Fusobacterium necrophorum grown in blood cultures by MALDI-TOF (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight) spectrometry -Vitek \u00aeMS Blood cultures performed at admission and on the second day and collected in standard anaerobic blood culture bottles were positive ().\nThe association of retropharyngeal abscess with thrombosis of the anterior jugular and involvement of other organs systemically and the microbiology led to the diagnosis of Lemierre\u2019s syndrome. Despite empirical antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (18 g/day, continuous infusion), there was a rapid worsening of the clinical conditions with further impairment of the respiratory failure and severe hemodynamic alterations (mean arterial pressure (MAP) constantly <65 mmHg). This picture suggested a progression towards a septic shock status. Consequently, the patient was referred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).\nA multimodal approach was the core of the ICU management of Lemierre\u2019s septic syndrome. It included source control, antibiotic therapy, anticoagulant therapy, hemodynamic support, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) ().\nThe source control was planned in a sterile environment. Under general anesthesia, the patient underwent an explorative puncture of the retropharyngeal abscess and surgical tracheostomy for airway protection. Unfortunately, although the procedure revealed purulent material, surgeons were unable to collect suitable samples for microbiological testing.\nAt ICU admission, the patient showed a clinical and radiological picture of acute lung injury and the need for deep sedation (propofol, remifentanil, and clonidine), and mechanical ventilation through protective ventilation (tidal volume 6 mL/kg and driving pressure < 15 cmH2O) and high FiO2 (80%). The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was 12, predicting a high mortality rate (50%) [].\nAbout antibiotic therapy, metronidazole (500 mg q8hr, intravenously) was added to piperacillin/tazobactam (started empirically at hospital admission). This antibiotic therapy was based on anecdotal clinical evidence because, due to the lack of cards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobes in the laboratory, the antibiogram was not performed.\nHemodynamic support was based on the synergic association of norepinephrine and the non-adrenergic vasopressor argipressin (also known as arginine-vasopressin or anti-diuretic hormone) (EMPRESSIN\u00ae AOP Orphan Pharmaceutical Group) starting with norepinephrine at 0.3 mcg/kg/min and argipressin at 0.03 IU/min to maintain a MAP > 65 mmHg and lactic acid < 2 mmol/L. On day 2, the drug synergism allowed the rapid reduction of the norepinephrine and argipressin dosages (0.1 mcg/kg/min and 0.025 IU/min, respectively) ().\nOn the same day (day 2), there was an enhancement in the clinical conditions, and the biomarkers of inflammation and organ failure improved ().\nDespite the adequate MAP (>65 mmHg), from the 3rd to the 6th day of ICU admission, there was a new worsening of the clinical status. It featured anemia (worse value 6.8 g/dL) without evidence of a hemorrhagic source. The hemodynamic monitoring (Edwards EV1000\u2122 device) showed a hyperdynamic septic state (Cardiac Output 15 L/min, Systemic Vascular Resistance 300 dynes/seconds/cm). Due to the worsening of the sepsis-related organ damage, on the 8th day, hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) was added to argipressin and norepinephrine. This approach led to a paramount hemodynamic improvement. From the 8th day of hospitalization, there was a progressive reduction of the dose of both vasoconstrictors until the suspension of norepinephrine, on day 9, and argipressin, on day 12 of ICU stay. Moreover, there was an important decrease in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (from 12 on ICU admission to 7 on day 9).\nThe worsening of the clinical status and the anemia were associated with bilirubin and cytokines rise. The inflammatory response was treated by 4 cycles of continuous hemofiltration (from 4th to 7th day). At the end of the procedure, there was an unexpected rise in D-dimers and in bilirubin values, up to 15.3 mg/dL (10th day), as well as hyperpyrexia. Nevertheless, these findings improved within 24 h.\nHeparin therapy was administered throughout the entire stay according to thrombocytopenia (enoxaparin 6000 U/day at the beginning and 4000 U twice a day after normalization of the platelet count) monitoring D-dimer values and avoiding intravascular coagulopathy.\nOn the 9th day, a chest tube was placed for the drainage of lung pleural effusion and a new CT was carried out. It showed a persistence of the known injuries of the lungs, liver, and spleen despite the paramount improvements of laboratory and clinical values, as well as the normalization of hemodynamic parameters at monitoring. The patient was discharged to the ward on the 17th day to continue the antibiotic therapy and the rehabilitation program. After the discharge to the rehabilitation care unit, the young man was in good health condition. At the first follow up, performed 15 days after ICU admission, the CT scan showed better lungs ventilation, absence of retropharyngeal abscess, laterocervical lymphadenopathy, and internal jugular thrombosis. Hepatosplenomegaly and some cavitary lungs lesions were found. Another thoracic CT scan was performed after 3 months.

She required invasive assisted ventilation shortly after admission. Her medical history included rheumatoid arthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, and arterial hypertension. Because of progressive severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the patient was transferred to our tertiary care hospital for kinetic therapy (prone positioning for at least 12 h per day) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to oliguric acute kidney injury (AKI) (A). Because of progressive hypoxemia, venovenous ECMO therapy was initiated 13 days after admission to our hospital (A). Subsequently, nasopharyngeal swabs and tracheal aspirates tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. After tracheotomy and weaning, ECMO therapy and invasive assisted ventilation were no longer required, but the patient still needed intermittent renal replacement therapy (IRRT) (A).\nDuring the course of the disease, the patient developed laboratory signs of liver injury during ECMO therapy before the clinical appearance of jaundice with elevated bilirubin levels, but sustained synthetic liver function reflected by the international normalized ratio (INR) and serum albumin measurements (B\u2013E). A diagnosis of SSC-CIP was confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), showing intraductal filling defects in the intrahepatic bile ducts due to biliary casts. In addition, the patient received drugs that have previously been associated with SSC, including amoxicillin-clavulanate, and ketamine sedation [,,]. Plasma levels of bilirubin and ammonia gradually increased after that, with stable liver synthesis reflected by normal values of the international normalized ratio (INR) without substituting coagulation factors (D,E).\nNevertheless, the patient developed progressive nausea, vomiting, weakness, and exhaustion as the disease progressed. Hepatic encephalopathy was treated with lactulose and rifaximin, but clinical symptoms worsened (A). Based on these observations, hemadsorption using the CytoSorb hemoperfusion device (CytoSorbents Europe, Berlin, Germany) was used in combination with IRRT (6 treatments within 7 days and 8\u201312 h per session). In this patient with SSC following ECMO therapy and severe COVID-19, hemadsorption successfully eliminated bilirubin, ammonia, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, while serum albumin levels remained stable (A). Direct comparison revealed that bilirubin was less efficiently eliminated by hemadsorption by 33% and 56% after 2 and 6 treatments, respectively (B) compared to ammonia by 65% and 74% after 2 and 6 treatments, respectively (C). During successful elimination of bilirubin and ammonia, clinical symptoms of nausea, vomiting, weakness, and exhaustion improved. Following a continuation of IRRT but termination of hemadsorption therapy, bilirubin (32.2 mg/dL) and ammonia levels (208 g/dL) increased again, worsening clinical symptoms within 20 days.

The patient\u2019s parents reported that tic onset had occurred when the patient was 9 years of age, when the patient began to exhibit a vocal tic (throat grunting). Motor tics developed at 11 years of age. The tics had worsened over the following three years, at which point the patient developed coprolalia. The patient presented to our movement disorders clinic with severe coprolalia and near-continuous simple and complex motor tics. The patient\u2019s tics were noted to significantly limit his activities of daily living, including self-feeding, self-care, social interaction, and school attendance. Attempts to type were unsuccessful, resulting only in repeated hits to the keyboard interrupted by motor tics. At the time of the initial consultation, the patient had been unable to attend school for over 8 months. He ex-pressed significant feelings of isolation and previous suicidal ideation 6 months prior to consultation. The patient displayed occasional self-injurious tic behavior, including lip/tongue biting and hitting himself in the arm and/or chest. Coprolalia was suggestible and triggerable, with frequency greater than 1/min, concurrent with complex motor tics.\nMultiple attempts at medical therapy included trials of escitalopram, benztropine, clonazepam, clonidine, sertraline, haloperidol, risperidone, guanfacine, and aripiprazole, all of which failed to decrease tic frequency for more than 4 weeks, at any dose administered. Escalation rate, maximum dose, duration, and concomitant medications were adjusted carefully to ensure that the failure of medical therapy was confirmed by an adequate medication trial. After treatment with a single dose of haloperidol, the patient had an acute dystonic reaction requiring hospitalization. Dystonia at that time was diagnosed by a pediatric movement disorder specialist (TDS) based on published criteria [,]. Haloperidol treatment was discontinued, and dystonia was resolved.\nGiven his lack of response to multiple medications and the severity of symptoms pre-venting activities of daily living including education, DBS surgery was discussed with the patient and his family. Since the optimal DBS target for Tourette syndrome is not known, we recommended use of a staged procedure with implantation of test leads at multiple possible targets []. The patient and his family consulted with neurosurgery (JKC, MAL) and elected to proceed with implantation of temporary depth electrodes at 12 sites and an anticipated hospitalization for testing of approximately 4\u20137 days.

Although showing depressive symptoms, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed., DSM-V) [], the latter could not be classified as a major episode of depression (MDD). She had suffered a circumscribed ischemic stroke two years earlier, which had left her with incomplete Broca\u2019s aphasia and dysprosody. By \u201cincomplete\u201d we mean two things here: (i) the fact that the severity of the speech impairment fluctuated over time, leaving the patient with better abilities on some days and worse on others, and (ii) the fact that the patient always retained some capability to express very simple words and phrases. However, due to the patient\u2019s refusal to undergo testing with psychometric scales, we were unable to assess the severity of this deficit through the use of more objective means, such as battery scores.\nThe examining physicians, becoming aware of the specific symptoms, retrospectively examined her file (after the consent of the patient and later of her husband), which contained all the clinical, laboratory, and imaging elements that had been collected.\nThe patient had no family or personal history of psychiatric diseases, nor SI/SB, prior to the onset of her language impairments. Her only other somatic complaint was hypertension. Her family was very supportive and consisted of a husband, three children, and several grand-children. The patient was bilingual in Italian and French and had been working as a writer and translator.\nAfter hospitalization in a psychiatric unit, a cerebral MRI was performed, revealing a diffuse white matter high-signal hyper-intensity in the left posteroinferior portion of the frontal lobe, just anterior to motor cortex. Small white matter high-signal hyper-intensities were also located in the frontal lobe of the right hemisphere. A neuropsychological investigation was not possible because of the patient\u2019s refusal.\nThe patient was started on psychotropic treatment with the antidepressant sertraline (increasing the dose gradually to 50 mg/day) and, with an anxiolytic purpose, quetiapine (12.5 mg \u00d7 3 per day), a drug that with higher posology is mainly prescribed to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. She was treated by a multidisciplinary team of psychiatrists, neurologists, psychologists, and speech therapists. Although the patient showed gradual improvements, both with regard to the anxious and depressive symptomatologies, we observed marked deteriorations in her psychiatric (increased anxiety and depressive symptoms) and neurological patterns (greater difficulty in finding words and more incongruent prosody) whenever she was asked to describe her situation and emotions to the best of her abilities. We also observed a marked improvement in her language expression abilities once her anxiety and depressive symptoms were controlled. The patient described feeling powerless after the onset of her language deficit, which, having been a professional a professional in the field of language, represented an immense and burdensome impairment for her, eventually leading to her SI and SA. The multidisciplinary team worked to offer her other means of expression besides language, and to mobilize her emotions by employing a range of approaches (art therapy, music therapy, psychomotricity, garden therapy, and pet therapy). Therapists attempted to elicit the activation and expression of complex emotional responses by showing her photographs, both generic and of the patient\u2019s family, by engaging the patient in small \u201crole-playing games\u201d that were interesting to the patient, and by encouraging her to use words in songs that she had memorized during her youth, and to which she was emotionally and affectively linked.\nWhile SI was fluctuant initially, after 6 months the patient no longer had any SI and showed an overall improvement. She was therefore discharged and referred to an outpatient facility where she continued treatment for about one year. Then, stating that she was feeling much better, the patient decided to no longer continue her treatment and also wanted to stop attending any sessions with both psychiatrist and speech therapists, contrary to medical advice at the time. Soon after, her anxious and depressive symptoms reappeared, her language expression deteriorated, and, 6 months after stopping her outpatient treatment, the patient performed suicide by drowning in a lake.", "age": [[74.0, "year"]], "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": {"25131519": 1, "22943140": 1, "7574464": 1, "33333732": 1, "23812172": 1, "14121178": 1, "23821774": 1, "11329395": 1, "29412528": 1, "31703982": 1, "25895218": 1, "19182182": 1, "17537499": 1, "17050338": 1, "11324179": 1, "8994697": 1, "8445372": 1, "24065898": 1, "22772687": 1, "17015085": 1, "32425828": 1, "32225017": 1, "10678515": 1, "25491561": 1, "12406115": 1, "33275047": 1, "17015084": 1, "22464009": 1, "2238017": 1, "25066266": 1, "25913539": 1, "32525785": 1, "19368760": 1, "33872934": 1, "26943459": 1, "28013040": 1, "29601506": 1, "33563806": 1, "28724589": 1, "11309452": 1, "32545811": 1, "12195096": 1, "27507865": 1, "33024437": 1, "30715721": 1, "30058742": 1, "15690829": 1, "27378956": 1, "22781400": 1, "22842869": 1, "27449996": 1, "28331011": 1, "34942896": 2}, "similar_patients": {}}, {"patient_id": "82", "patient_uid": "8699826-1", "PMID": "34943567", "file_path": "comm/PMC008xxxxxx/PMC8699826.xml", "title": "In Vitro Fertilization Using Preimplantation Genetic Testing in a Romanian Couple Carrier of Mutations in the TTN Gene: A Case Report and Literature Review", "patient": "The mother, 34-years old, primigravida (G0P0), underwent all recommended tests. The first-trimester morphology scan revealed normal crown-rump length, visible nasal bone, and normal nuchal translucency value. Moreover, the double marker for chromosomal aneuploidies (13, 18, and 21) indicated a low-level risk. The TORCH IgM and IgG screening showed no acute or recent infection (negative IgM), and the IgG titer was high. The woman had not been previously exposed to harmful factors that would have justified placing the pregnancy in the high-risk category. The second-trimester morphology scan performed at 22 weeks confirmed the normal development of a female fetus.\nHowever, at 33 weeks of pregnancy, the first abnormal sign was noted. The amniotic fluid quantity started to increase, leading to the diagnosis of polyhydramnios. Another visible alteration was the shape and position of the lower fetal limbs, indicating minor clubfoot and altered fetal biophysical profile. By the time the pregnancy reached 36 weeks, the biophysical variables were severely modified. The fetal heart rate monitored using the non-stress test was worrying. There were significant decelerations, abnormal fetal movement, and poor muscular tonus. Additionally, the quantity of amniotic fluid continued to rise. Cumulatively, these observations led to the decision to deliver the baby prematurely via emergency C-section, 36 weeks into the pregnancy.\nThe C-section was uneventful, and the mother made a fast recovery, but the female newborn weighing 2200 g received an APGAR score of 3. Unfortunately, when thoroughly examined by our team, it was noticeable that the fetus\u2019s movement, breathing, and swallowing capacity were impaired, and she was unable to sustain spontaneous breathing. The newborn was constantly and fully dependent on assisted mechanical ventilation. Her condition continued to deteriorate despite all the efforts. Unfortunately, at two months of age, the baby succumbed to respiratory failure and multiple associated complications.\nBased on the clinical signs and paraclinical tests, we were able to establish the following diagnostics: generalized congenital muscular atony, right diaphragmatic hernia, cerebral atrophy, neonatal anemia, bilateral varus equinus, neonatal hypocalcemia, prematurity and low birth weight, ostium secundum atrial heart defect, and tricuspid valve dysplasia.\nThoracic X-rays show reduced ribcage expansion of the right hemithorax, suggestive of right diaphragmatic hernia. The transfontanelar ultrasound and head CT showed moderate cerebral atrophy, mostly in the frontal lobe. The generalized and severe muscular hypotonia was investigated using a muscular biopsy that showed no significant alterations. Both tests for aminoacidopathies and spinal muscular atrophy were negative. Serum levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were high but with a tendency to normalize. The karyotype showed a normal profile 46XX.\nGiven the multitude of heterogenic clinical symptoms, we suspected a genetic syndrome yet to be diagnosed, so we proceeded to perform an Array Comparative Genome Hybridization (aCGH) with Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP). aCGH+SNP was conducted on a blade with 4 \u2217 180,000 (180 K) samples (110.112 CGH samples, 59.647 SNP samples, 3000 replicated samples and 8121 control samples) covering the entire human genome with a spatial resolution of ~25.3 kb DNA (G4890A, design ID: 029830, UCSC hg19, Agilent). The scans were interpreted with the CytoGenomics Agilent software, using standard interpretation parameters with a SureScan Microarray Scanner. The resulting profile was abnormal: there were three areas associated with loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 1 (q25.1\u2013q25.3) of 6115 kb, 5 (p15.2\u2013p15.1) of 2589 kb and 8 (q11.21\u2013q11.23) of 4830 kb, a duplication of 1104 kb on chromosome 10 in the position q11.22, and duplication of 1193 kb on chromosome 16 in the position p11.2p11.1.\nConsidering this abnormal genetic profile, the parental couple received genetic counseling. Furthermore, we continued to test both partners through Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) by Illumina.\nThe results confirmed the following abnormal genetic profile; TTN (NM_001267550.1, sequencing): heterozygous variant on Chr2(GRCh37):g.179479653G>C\u2014TTN variant c.48681C>G p.(Tyr16227*)\u2014exon 260, heterozygous variant on Chr2(GRCh37):g.179396832_179396833del\u2014TTN variant c.104509_104510del p.(Leu34837Glufs*12)\u2014exon 358 (TTN: NM_001267550.1\u2014reference sequence). The TTN variant c.48681C>G p.(Tyr16227*) creates a premature stop codon. Sanger sequencing also confirmed this variant and was classified as likely pathogenic (class 2). The TTN variant c.104509_104510del p.(Leu34837Glufs*12) creates a shift in the reading frame starting at codon 34837. The new reading frame ends in a stop codon 11 positions downstream. This variant has been confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and it is also classified as likely pathogenic (class 2) ().\nIn light of the clinical outcomes, based on the previous unfortunate experience, the couple agreed to receive genetic counseling. The couple was advised to pursue in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic testing (PGT-M). Considering the mother\u2019s age and weight, her Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) serum level and antral follicle count, we used a short-antagonist ovarian stimulation (OS) protocol with 200 UI of FSH (follitropin beta) concomitantly with 150 UI of combined FSH and LH (menotropin). Ten days later, seven oocytes were retrieved through transvaginal, sonographically controlled follicle puncture. Five of them were injected through intracytoplasmic intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI), resulting in two blastocysts. The embryonic biopsy was performed on day 6 of the blastocyst stage for these two embryos ().\nThe amplification of the entire genome was performed using the SurePlex DNA Amplification System by Illumina Inc. 2018, California US. Using the BlueFuse Multi Analysis Software (Illumina Inc. 2018, San Diego, CA, USA), all 24 chromosomes were detected euploid for embryos. The identification of the mutation TTN gene on exon 358 (father\u2019s mutation) and exon 260 (mother\u2019s mutation) was performed only for euploid embryos using Sanger sequencing with specific primers on ABI 3500. PCR products for both embryos were purified and sequenced in both senses with a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit by Thermo Fisher Scientific. Specific primers were manually designed according to both mutations and tested afterwards using blood samples from the parents. Both embryos tested by PGT-A were euploid. One of them was a carrier of the mother\u2019s mutation c.48681C>G p.(Tyr16227), exon 260, and the other was a wild type (WT) for both mutations ().\nWe performed a frozen-thawed embryo transfer in the following cycle, transferring the WT euploid embryo after endometrial preparation with exogenous estrogen. The result was positive, and we confirmed the ongoing viable pregnancy via ultrasound 14 days after.\nThroughout the pregnancy, we performed the non-invasive double marker test (low-risk result) and fetal DNA analysis using maternal blood (low-risk result) and an invasive amniocentesis at 17 weeks of gestation, indicating a normal genetic profile. To test whether or not the second fetus presents a genetic abnormality, we extracted the DNA directly from the amniotic fluid. Targeted sequencing was performed on both DNA strands of the relevant TTN region. The reference sequence is TTN: NM_001267550.2. To exclude maternal cell contamination (MCC), we analyzed 15 STR autosomal markers plus amelogenin using the PowerPlex 16HS multiplex kit (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Moreover, all the non-invasive ultrasound scans showed a normal growth rate and organ development. The evolution of the pregnancy was uneventful, and at 38 weeks, we carried out the C-section delivery of a healthy female baby of 2990 g, receiving an APGAR score of 9.", "age": [[34.0, "year"]], "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": {"31316546": 1, "12145747": 1, "28954035": 1, "30756205": 1, "32124191": 1, "31911674": 1, "29435569": 1, "24105469": 1, "23680132": 1, "20133654": 1, "32684825": 1, "27854229": 1, "33449170": 1, "11717165": 1, "17444505": 1, "22335739": 1, "29691892": 1, "26275891": 1, "32502767": 1, "10029346": 1, "31588198": 1, "32981126": 1, "23486992": 1, "28214268": 1, "18477606": 1, "11788824": 1, "32747765": 1, "31759551": 1, "23606733": 1, "11294923": 1, "11455396": 1, "22577215": 1, "30712880": 1, "26581302": 1, "34943567": 2}, "similar_patients": {}}, {"patient_id": "83", "patient_uid": "8699836-1", "PMID": "34943480", "file_path": "comm/PMC008xxxxxx/PMC8699836.xml", "title": "Symptomatic Intraosseous Lipoma of the Calcaneum", "patient": "A 40-year-old male engineer, former professional rugby player, was referred to our clinic with a left heel inflammatory pain that was worsening during jogging or trailing.

Patient was recommended a break from physical activity for six months and non-steroid anti-inflammatories drugs (NSAIDS) to ameliorate pain. The pain increased gradually and he started to complain of swelling. The pain was hardly controlled with NSAIDS and non-morphinic analgesics.\nOur clinical examination revealed a mild tenderness in the posterior foot, including the ankle and the heel, without evidence of a palpable mass. Ankle and subtalar joint mobilities were limited. The laboratory blood tests and urine analysis results were normal.\nRadiography revealed a benign-appearing bone lesion of 16 \u00d7 19 mm within the anteroinferior part of the calcaneum which was well defined, radiolucent, almost entirely homogeneous with a small central sclerotic focus-\u201cCockade sign\u201d [,], describing the classical appearance of a calcaneal intraosseous lipoma (). We also performed and MRI exam that showed a focal lesion, hyperintense on both T1 and T2 weighted images, and isointense with fatty tissues (a,b). There was a discreet focal attenuation in the center of the lesion, on T2* sequence, suggestive for focal calcification (c). The MRI aspect corresponded to a Milgram type II intraosseous lipoma (predominantly fatty lesions with central necrosis/calcifications/ ossifications) [].\nSurgery was performed and a direct lateral approach to the calcaneum was chosen. The saphenous nerve and the long peroneus tendon were reclined superiorly and distally (a). A bone window was performed immediate distally to the lateral tubercle of the calcaneum. Aggressive curettage of the lesion was carried out and the intralesional samples were send to the histopathological exam (b). The cavity was filled with a medium viscosity poly (methyl methacrylate)-based bone cement with gentamycin. No perioperative complications occurred.\nThe histopathological exam () and immunohistochemistry (S100 and Vimentin positive) confirmed the diagnosis, a stage II Milgram intraosseous lipoma.\nPostoperatively, the pain subsided completely. The patient was discharged the second day after the surgery. Total weight bearing was allowed without crutches. No cast or brace was applied. Rehabilitation was conducted for two weeks in order to encourage full ankle mobilities.\nIn the follow-up, the patient was evaluated every six weeks during the first three months and every six months until the first two years after surgery.

The post-transplant immunosuppression (IS) regimen included tacrolimus 5 mg twice daily, prednisone 20 mg daily, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1000 mg twice daily.\nHe remained relatively well until seven years post-transplant when he presented with right foot pain and right lower extremity swelling for a duration of 4 weeks. Doppler ultrasound showed an acute right popliteal, tibial, and peroneal deep venous thrombosis for which he was prescribed apixaban. Two months after the initiation of anticoagulation therapy, he presented with a recurrence of right lower extremity swelling, increased pain and numbness, and a new weakening of the right foot. Further history revealed progressive fatigue, dyspnea, and a 30-pound weight loss over 3 months.\nA computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed scattered lung nodules with multiple areas of bilateral thoracic lymphadenopathy. A positron emission tomography (PET-CT) revealed the abnormal FDG uptake of numerous, sub-centimeter bilateral pulmonary nodules (max SUV 8.4) with mediastinal (1.6 cm, max SUV 13.4), bilateral hilar, right femoral, inguinal adenopathy, and abnormal FDG uptake in a soft tissue mass adjacent to the proximal right femur (5.8 \u00d7 3.9 cm2, max SUV 11.9) ().\nAn excisional biopsy of the soft tissue mass showed diffuse infiltration with atypical monomorphic lymphoid cells with large regions of necrosis (). By immunohistochemistry the tumor cells expressed CD3, CD4, CD30 (30%), and BCL-2, and were negative for CD5, CD8, CD10, CD20, CD21, TIA-1, perforin, T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma, and ALK-1. In situ hybridization for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)-encoded RNA was negative and plasma EBV DNA was not detectable. The proliferation index estimated by Ki-67 staining was 70\u201380%. TCR gene rearrangement analysis showed a monoclonal band for both the TCR gamma and beta genes. A bone marrow biopsy showed normocellular bone marrow, with trilineage hematopoietic maturation, and no lymphoid aggregates or atypical lymphoid cells, but with a mononoclonal TCR rearrangement identical to that found in the soft tissue mass, consistent with a low-level involvement by T-cell lymphoma. He was diagnosed with stage IV CD30-positive T-cell PTLD, peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), which was not otherwise specified (NOS).\nAt the time of the PTLD diagnosis, IS therapy consisted only of tacrolimus 1 mg twice daily. After discussion with the transplant team, the tacrolimus dose was decreased to 0.5 mg twice daily, and CHOP-21 chemotherapy was initiated. However, based on the emerging ECHELON-2 outcomes with the addition of brentuximab vedotin (BV) to an anthracycline-based chemotherapy backbone in CD30-positive PTCL, after two cycles of CHOP, the patient\u2019s chemotherapy regimen was changed to BV-CHP [,,]. BV was dosed at 1.8 mg/kg with CHP every 3 weeks with G-CSF support, according to the published ECHELON-2 regimen [,]. Cycle 3 (BV-CHP #1) was complicated by neutropenic sepsis, and BV was reduced to 1.3 mg/kg for cycles 4\u20136. Cycle 4 (BV-CHP #2) was again complicated by neutropenic sepsis, and cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin dosing were reduced by 25% for the remaining cycles 5 and 6. Interim PET-CT after cycle 4 showed a complete resolution of previously seen pulmonary metastases, a decrease in the mediastinal (1.3 cm, max SUV 9.3; from pre-treatment 1.6 cm, max SUV 13.4) and hilar adenopathy, and a near complete resolution of the soft tissue mass in the right anterior thigh (2.4 \u00d7 2.3 cm2, max SUV 1.68, from pre-treatment 5.8 \u00d7 3.9 cm2, max SUV 11.9), overall consistent with a partial response (PR). End-of-treatment PET-CT after cycle 6 showed stable disease in the mediastinal (1.3 cm, max SUV 10.25) and hilar adenopathy, and no new or recurrent adenopathy, with complete resolution of the previously seen right lower extremity soft tissue mass, consistent with ongoing PR (). Maintenance therapy with single-agent BV was discussed and started, but after one BV maintenance dose he was again admitted with a neutropenic febrile episode and the patient requested to stop all therapy, as he was satisfied with the achieved response.\nFollowing completion of front-line therapy, his course was complicated by elevations of alkaline phosphatase (peak 417 U/L 3 months post-treatment initiation, from pre-treatment 97 U/L) and AST (peak 75 U/L 11 months post-treatment initiation, from pre-treatment 33 U/L) levels. ALT remained within normal limits. A liver biopsy completed 8 months after treatment initiation showed minimal lobular inflammation, but no evidence of portal inflammation, bile duct injury, or endothelitis, as seen with acute cellular rejection, and no ductopenia, as seen with chronic rejection.\nDue to chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and an episode of duodenal ulcer bleeding, his anticoagulation was briefly interrupted and then re-initiated after endoscopy clipping and the recovery of thrombocytopenia.

The current pregnancy presented a low risk for aneuploidy according to the performed cell-free fetal DNA test. The classical karyotype performed after the abortion did not reveal any chromosomal abnormalities.\nPrevious ultrasound evaluations were incongruent and reported the following findings:an isolated aortic arch anomaly (supposedly aneurysmal dilation from which the left common carotid artery emerges) and coarctation of the aorta with the anterograde flow; ventricular septal defect, coarctation of the aorta, and a vascular formation located superior from the aortic arch with the appearance of an arteriovenous fistula; aneurysmal dilation located above the pulmonary trunk bifurcation and a dilated left common carotid artery with a retrograde flow; minor ventricular septal defect with a normal ductus venosus triphasic flow.\nWe performed fetal echocardiography, which demonstrated a mild cardiomegaly with a left deviated 72-degree heart axis, normal aspect of the four-chamber view, a small membranous ventricular septal defect, and ductal aortic coarctation; the ductus venosus flow was normal (, and ). In addition, we identified an aneurysmal structure measuring 1.63/1.25/1.16 cm with turbulent Doppler flow, situated above the emergence of the pulmonary trunk and continued by a dilated vascular structure that bifurcates in the cervical region; the aneurysm seemed connected to the left pulmonary artery as well. A dilated left subclavian artery was also suspected (, and ).\nIn the context of complex cardio-vascular malformations, the patient requested the termination of the pregnancy by drug-induced abortion.\nThe hands-on dissection of the fetus revealed a set of abnormalities that could stand as an anatomical basis for what has been found during the ultrasound examination.\nThe first and the most pronounced aspect was the distention of the whole venous system of the neck and mediastinum. The specimen presented a linguo-facial vein that described a rather sinuous pathway alongside the inferior margin of the mandible (). Both the linguo-facial vein and the external jugular vein appeared with a markedly increased caliber, around 4\u20135 times larger than expected for this gestational age. Both left and right jugular veins and the right subclavian vein were assessed as three times larger than usual, respecting the normal relations to the neighboring structures ( and ).\nThe confluence between the left jugular and subclavian vein into the left brachiocephalic vein was observed to be very dilated to superior and inferior, extending above the superior margin of the omohyoid muscle as well as below the inferior concavity of the aortic arch. Moreover, on the inferior side of the enlarged brachiocephalic vein, a vessel could be observed descending lateral to the left vagus nerve and communicating with the left pulmonary artery. The left pulmonary artery was observed to be dilated as well, around twice as normal ().\nRegarding the great vessels of the heart, there are some anomalies to be discussed. A narrowing of the aortic arch was identified distally to the emergence of the left subclavian artery ( and ). A large, patent ductus arteriosus was found, ending right at the narrowing level observed in the aortic arch (ending right at the coarctation level) (). The left subclavian artery was dilated as well, sizing as much as the ascending aorta and the aortic arch, creating the illusion of a terminal branch rather than a lateral one ( and ).\nHeart analysis concluded no distinct changes in heart architectural formation for this gestational age. Atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial concordance was noted. Atria and ventricles were increased in relation to the mediastinum.

The patient had been previously healthy and had no specific medical or surgical history. She had an irregular menstruation cycle, and her last menstruation occurred five weeks and six days previously. The initial vital signs at the emergency room were stable; systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 114 mmHg and 68 mmHg, respectively. The initial pulse rate was 71 beats per minute. Whole abdominal tenderness with muscle guarding was noted on physical examination. Blood tests showed a low hemoglobin level (10.7 g/dL). A urinary pregnancy test was positive, and the serum \u03b2-HCG level was 7377.0 mIU/mL. Gynecological sonography found no evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy, except for normal bilateral adnexa with free fluid collection, suggestive of hemoperitoneum. After eight hours, the follow up blood test showed a lower hemoglobin level (8.6 g/dL). Two packs of packed red blood cells were transfused. We suspected a ruptured ectopic pregnancy through elevated serum \u03b2-HCG, but the ectopic mass could not be identified on pelvic ultrasound. Thus, we planned abdominopelvic computed tomography (APCT) to determine the cause of the right frank pain. Approximately 2 cm hypervascular mass in the subphrenic region, with a moderate amount of hemoperitoneum, was revealed (), which was thought to be the cause of the bleeding. Because of suspicions of a diaphragmatic ectopic pregnancy or other ruptured unknown hepatic mass, she was admitted for emergency surgery. Diagnostic laparoscopic surgery was performed in collaboration with a hepatobiliary surgeon and an obstetrician-gynecologist. On laparoscopy, about 400 mL of blood and clots were aspirated from the pelvic cavity, but both adnexa appeared normal. Approximately 20 \u00d7 10 cm tissue, suspected to be the placenta with a hematoma, had covered the diaphragm. After the removal of the placenta-like tissues, we found a 2 cm hypervascular mass attached to the diaphragm (). The mass was completely resected from the diaphragm and sent for histological examination. After the surgical mass removal, the patient was discharged without any postoperative complications, and the serum \u03b2-HCG level normalized within a month.

Physical examination revealed right-sided abdominal tenderness. Laboratory examination revealed slightly higher bilirubin levels (0.4 mg/dL), but serum amylase and lipase levels, and complete blood count were all within the normal range. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated a large cystic mass in the head of the pancreas, which measured 8.1 \u00d7 7.5 \u00d7 7.4 cm, and dilatation of the common bile duct, measuring 22 mm in diameter. There was also dilatation of the pancreatic duct, measuring 5 mm in diameter. The remainder of the pancreas was grossly unremarkable. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). The EUS FNA fluid test showed a CEA level > 900 ng/mL, and fluid cytology was negative for malignancy or high-grade dysplasia. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed with biliary stent placement, which led to the resolution of his jaundice. An extended pylorus-sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. The operation was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 4 days after surgery.\nGross examination: The pancreatic head was entirely replaced by a mass lesion measuring 8.2 \u00d7 7.9 \u00d7 7.2 cm and was a unilocular cystic lesion containing gray-green turbid fluid with granular material. The cyst structure appeared to communicate with both the main and side duct branches. The cyst lining was gray-green to yellow, trabecular, and glistening to granular with few fibrous strands that arborized through the cystic structure and anchored at opposing sides of the cyst. Using a standard pancreatic cancer sampling protocol, paraffin-embedded sections of formalin-fixed tissue were studied by routine histology at the Indiana University Pathology Laboratory.\nMicroscopic examination: Histologically, the tumor showed two components composed of an epithelial component and a spindle cell component that were intimately intermingled together. The epithelial component had features ranging from well differentiated to moderately and poorly differentiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The majority of the epithelial component was well differentiated with simple small to large ductal structures lined by a single layer of columnar to cuboidal cells, which had small and basally located nuclei with smooth and round nuclear contours and open chromatin. They had a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm without mucinous content (). The moderately differentiated component showed a more complex glandular structure with convoluted and interconnected ducts with a single layer of cells or a cribriform-type structure including multiple layers of cells with enlarged and irregular nuclei (). Some areas showed prototypical morphology of conventional pancreatic ductal carcinoma with small and angulated ducts infiltrating the desmoplastic stroma. The poorly differentiated epithelial component was small and focal. It showed vague and poorly formed ductal structures, or solid nests to small sheets of dispersed epithelioid cells with no ductal structures (). These cells had enlarged vesicular nuclei with irregular nuclear contours and conspicuous nucleoli. The spindle cell component was highly cellular with compact spindle cells, which showed hyperchromatic and elongated nuclei with scant cytoplasm. There was rare mitosis in the epithelial component, but the spindle cell component showed frequent mitosis with up to 12 mitoses per 10 high-power fields. Frequent apoptosis was also observed in spindle cell areas. Scattered necrotic areas were present in both components. There were no osteoclast-like giant cells or rhabdomyoblasts and no osteoid formation. There were foci of hemosiderin deposition, especially in the spindle cell areas surrounding the cystic lining. None of the ducts showed papillary or mucinous features. No areas subjacent to the epithelial component showed ovarian stroma-like features. All margins were negative for tumor. Twenty lymph nodes were present, all of which were negative for metastatic tumors. The pathologic staging was pT3pN0.\nImmunohistochemistry: Extensive immunohistochemical studies were performed at the Indiana University Pathology Laboratory due to the mixed features of the lesion (). The epithelial component was positive for markers of pancytokeratin AE1/AE3, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), CK7, and CK19, and negative for MUC2, MUC5, MUC6, synaptophysin, and chromogranin. Spindle cells were negative for these markers. The spindle cells were diffusely positive for vimentin and DOG1 with patchy positivity for S100. Both epithelial and spindle tumor cells were negative for the estrogen receptor, CD10, inhibin, TLE1, SOX10, Melan A, HMB45, actin, desmin, myogenin, MyoD1, STAT6, and CD117. No nuclear staining was observed for \u03b2-catenin. CD163 highlighted cells with hemosiderin deposition, consistent with histiocytes. The tumor cells were negative for CD21 and CD35 expression. P53 showed a wild type staining pattern with no complete loss or overexpression in tumor cells of both components. Cyclin D1 showed patchy nuclear staining in the epithelial component but was negative in the spindle cell component. P16 was positive in the spindle cell component but negative in the epithelial component. The spindle cells demonstrated approximately 20% positivity of Ki-67 nuclear staining, while it showed only scant (about 2%) nuclear staining in the epithelial component (). Additional immunohistochemical staining for PDL-1 (SP142), MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 was performed at the Caris Life Science Laboratory (Phoenix, Arizona) and showed negativity (0%) for PDL-1 expression and intact protein expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2.\nMolecular study: Molecular analysis of the tumor tissue was first performed by Indiana University Molecular Pathology Laboratory and showed that the tumor was microsatellite stable with no mutation in BRAF, KRAS, and NRAS genes. Additionally, the tumor tissue was sent to the Caris Life Science Laboratory (Phoenix, AZ, USA) for next generation sequencing analysis of whole exome sequencing (WES). Direct sequence analysis was performed on genomic DNA using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencers. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was low and genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was also low, with 10% of the tested genomic segments exhibiting LOH. The whole exome sequencing in our case showed no pathogenic alterations in the genes, such as BRAF, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, SMAD4, NRG1, and NTRK1/2/3.

She reported pain in the left wrist and hand, with intensity 10 on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS), pulsating, and always present, thus preventing any movement. Marked hypersensitivity and allodynia were present at the level of the left fingers, wrist and hand. Pain was present in both flexion and extension of the wrist and caused a marked reduction in strength in the left wrist and hand, making a handshake impossible for the girl. There was no redness but swelling and sweating at the level of the fingers of the left hand. The pain was so intense that it interfered with her regular attendance at school, generating social withdrawal phenomena, which are unfortunately very frequent in patients with chronic pain.\nPain began three months before the consultation, after an accidental fall with trauma to the left wrist. It gradually increased and did not respond to either NSAIDs or limb immobilization. The diagnostic tests performed at the time (X-ray, Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging) were negative, as were the blood chemistry tests ( and ).\nFrom the age of 8, the girl was followed by a pediatrician in our hospital for a history of cramps and pain in the lower limbs, especially in the ankle and left knee, both in the absence of trauma or caused by frequent falls. In the following years, clinicians found bilateral flatfoot (with subsequent surgery), mild ligamentous hyperlaxity and vitamin D deficiency. In addition, borderline cognitive level with motor coordination disorder and executive function deficit, as well as stuttering, were then diagnosed. Elements of anxiety emerged from the administration of Self Administered Psychiatric Scales for Children and Adolescents (SAFA-A, D and S) questionnaires, as highlighted in particular by the subscales \u201cSeparation anxiety\u201d and \u201cGeneralized anxiety\u201d [,]. Concern for one\u2019s own health was observed, with experiences of herself as being ill; the scores indicate a propensity to somatize. There was a tone of mood oriented in a deflected sense, and insecurity. The results of the Lie scale were: 8; T: 65 [,]. In addition to pulsating headache with phono and photophobia, frontal epilepsy was also diagnosed, which could explain the frequent falls, and moreover had excluded hyperbaric oxygen therapy as a feasible regimen in this case (due to a cost/benefit evaluation, and increased exposure to oxygen toxicity during the treatment itself). Episodes of dizziness with difficulty in maintaining an upright position lasting a few hours were also observed, and on two occasions she also had an episode of unconsciousness lasting about 2 min.\nDuring the first visit, as a consequence of the mother\u2019s need to have time to convince the recalcitrant daughter, in the meantime it was recommended to administer oral tramadol (100 mg/mL), 5 gtt in the morning and 5 gtt in order to reduce musculoskeletal pain. The reason for choosing a drug such as tramadol rather than any other pharmacological option lies in the fact that the pain was so intense that it affected the patient\u2019s relationships []. We therefore opted for a drug that would have an immediate effect, so as to be able to undertake the acupuncture course. Subsequently, in the first two sessions, after careful disinfection of the skin with 2% chlorhexidine, and using the appropriate needles for length and diameter based on the type of acupuncture and the selected points, we used the following acupoints: TE 4 (Yang Pool), TE 5 (Waiguan), LI 5 (Yang Xi) and SI 4 (Wan Gu), all on the left side. These points were chosen on the basis of a pathology which, according to traditional Chinese medicine, was caused by cold wind. These points produced heat and dissipated the wind []. The needles were kept for 30\u2032, with stimulation every 10\u2032. In the third session, the girl reported a slight improvement in the painful symptoms but at the same time unbearable pain in the affected limb during the previous sessions due to the insertion and maintenance of the needles in the affected area. We decided to change strategy and to use abdominal acupuncture and stimulation of the points CV 4 (Guan Yuan), CV 12 (Zhong Wan), CV 16 (Zhong Ting), CV 17 (Shan Zong), ST 24 bilateral (Huaroumen) and KI 17 bilateral (Shang Qu), with appropriate needles and maintaining the same interspeed and time of stimulation. The needles were inserted to a depth of 0.2 cun. These new points (CV 4, CV 12, CV 16, CV 17 and KI 17), in addition to heating and dissipating the wind, re-established the correct circulation of qi []. In fact, used in combination, their purpose was to move the qi from the kidney to the extremity of the upper limb passing through the shoulder [,]. ST 24 was used to calm the patient and increase her compliance with acupuncture [].\nAuriculotherapy was also associated with Vaccaria seeds on the Wrist, Hand and Shenmen points, with the recommendation to stimulate them at home for 10 min, 4 times a day until the next session. Vaccaria seeds are used to stimulate certain points in auriculotherapy due to their almost spherical shape, and the absence of pharmacological properties []. The Shenmen point was chosen for its anxiolytic effect, given the patient\u2019s psychological difficulties [].\nAfter eight sessions (two months) of abdominal acupuncture the pain completely disappeared (Numeric Pain Rating Scale value 0) and the girl regained full functional capacity of the arm and a normal life. Follow-up at three months, six months and one year demonstrated complete remission of symptoms, with constant values of NRS equal to 0. The reduction in pain, and subsequently its total disappearance, allowed the patient to resume normal school attendance, and therefore to resume a life of normal, balanced relationships.", "age": [[13.0, "year"]], "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": {"32115056": 1, "19557115": 1, "29898171": 1, "25844555": 1, "32694387": 1, "21208130": 1, "30586070": 1, "29198932": 1, "592092": 1, "20807353": 1, "30863143": 1, "32551810": 1, "20493633": 1, "12749974": 1, "34289443": 1, "25541523": 1, "34744457": 1, "28715459": 1, "18373513": 1, "33259079": 1, "21078546": 1, "32986618": 1, "31478951": 1, "32370536": 1, "24836741": 1, "33192771": 1, "33729210": 1, "33004170": 1, "15135942": 1, "21872098": 1, "34943383": 2}, "similar_patients": {}}, {"patient_id": "95", "patient_uid": "8699977-1", "PMID": "34943306", "file_path": "comm/PMC008xxxxxx/PMC8699977.xml", "title": "Children with Heiner Syndrome: A Single-Center Experience", "patient": "Case 1 was a 2-year-old boy who was admitted to the department of hemato-oncology due to pallor without respiratory symptoms or signs including no hemoptysis.

She was lethargic and did not suck well with swallowing only 10 to 20 mL of formula at a time in the last two days. However, the amount of urine did not decrease, and diapers were changed 10 to 14 times per day. Vomiting and diarrhea were not observed. She was born at 38+2 weeks of gestation with 3380 g (50th\u201375th percentile) via cesarean section. No abnormal findings were noted during the prenatal and immediate postnatal periods. She was the first child of healthy, nonconsanguineous Korean parents, and her family history was unremarkable. At admission, her weight was 3100 g (25th\u201350th percentile), length was 53 cm (50th\u201375th percentile), and head circumference was 36 cm (50th\u201375th percentile). Although vital signs were appropriate for her age (heart rate 150 beats/min, blood pressure 78/50 mmHg, respiratory rate 48 breaths/min, and body temperature 36.5 \u00b0C), her lips were dry, and the capillary refill time was prolonged to 5\u20136 s. Physical examination revealed both thumbs in palms, frontal bossing, prominent upper lip, high arched palate, sparse frontal scalp hair, and bilateral 5th finger clinodactyly. An initial capillary blood gas analysis showed severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7.16, pCO2 28.3 mmHg, pO2 42 mmHg, HCO3\u2212\u201417.3 mmol/L, base excess\u201417.3 mmol/L). With an impression of dehydration, 20 mL/kg normal saline was infused intravenously for over 1 h before other laboratory results were obtained.\nThe laboratory tests at admission were as follows: serum sodium 113.3 mEq/L, serum potassium 8.79 mEq/L, serum chloride 90.8 mEq/L, total CO2 8.1 mEq/L, serum lactic acid 1.0 mmol/L, serum ketone body 24 \u00b5mol/L, blood glucose level 83 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 55.1 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 0.65 mg/dL. Her urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.014 and pH 5.0 and was negative for white blood cells and red blood cells. Her spot urine sodium and potassium levels were 74 and 27.7 mEq/L, respectively. The serum and urine osmolality values were 232 and 229 mOsm/kg, respectively. All the results of the neonatal screening test were normal, which included TSH (1.2 mIU/L), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (1.6 ng/mL), total galactose (1.0 mg/dL), and mass spectrometry for amino acid, organic acid, fatty acid, purine, peroxisome, and carbohydrate metabolic disorders. The plasma ammonia level was within the normal limit as 97 \u00b5g/dL. The plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone level were markedly elevated to 142.0 ng/mL/h (normal range, 0.32\u20131.84 ng/mL/h) and 4560 ng/dL (normal range, 4.2\u201320.9 ng/dL), respectively. Renal ultrasonography revealed no abnormalities except mild hydronephrosis in the right kidney (). No abnormal findings were found in cardiac echocardiography or brain magnetic resonance imaging.\nTo correct severe hyponatremia, 60 mL of 3% sodium chloride was initially intravenously administered over 8 h. Her urine output on the first day of admission was 8.45 mL/kg/h. Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia were improved with intravenous fluid and oral sodium chloride supplementation (8 mEq/kg/day). The patient consumed an adequate amount of milk (170\u2013200 mL/kg/day), and weight gain was appropriate (40\u201380 g/day) after oral sodium chloride supplementation.\nFor the genetic diagnosis of the patient, targeted exome sequencing (TES) was performed. Genomic DNA was extracted from proband blood. All exon regions of all human genes (~22,000) were captured by a Twist Human Core Exome Kit (Twist Bioscience, South San Francisco, CA, USA). The captured regions of the genome were sequenced using a NovaSeq 6000 sequencing machine (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). In TES, no other pathogenic/likely pathogenic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) or small insertion and deletion variants associated with the clinical phenotypes were identified. However, her clinical phenotypes and biochemical results indicated PHA1. Therefore, we performed a chromosomal microarray (CMA) to identify deletion-encompassing genes responsible for PHA1. CMA (CytoScan Dx, Affymetrix Cytogenetics, Santa Clara, CA, USA) revealed a 203 kb heterozygous deletion at 4q31.23: arr[GRCh37] 4q31.23(148865586_149069090)x1 (). This deletion spans exons 7\u20139 of NR3C2 and exons 15\u201323 of the ARHGAP10 gene. Haploinsufficiency of the NR3C2 gene, which encodes the mineralocorticoid receptor, is responsible for ADPHA1. However, the details of the functional role of the ARHGAP10 gene in human disease remain unclear. Parental testing showed that the deletion was paternally inherited. Her father had no history of clinical PHA1 manifestation and had normal plasma electrolytes and serum aldosterone values with only slightly elevated plasma renin activity at testing.", "age": [[20.0, "day"]], "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": {"21932599": 1, "24455331": 1, "24616761": 1, "19571553": 1, "16611713": 1, "33017655": 1, "32021607": 1, "32778955": 1, "12107247": 1, "8589714": 1, "28348114": 1, "9662404": 1, "16972228": 1, "34943285": 2}, "similar_patients": {}}, {"patient_id": "99", "patient_uid": "8700032-1", "PMID": "34940005", "file_path": "comm/PMC008xxxxxx/PMC8700032.xml", "title": "Bridging the Gap between Ophthalmology and Emergency Medicine in Community-Based Emergency Departments (EDs): A Neuro-Ophthalmology Guide for ED Practitioners", "patient": "A 75-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of well-controlled hypertension and hypercholesterolemia presents to the ED with complaints of a new-onset headache.

GCA can cause enhancement of the optic nerve or orbit on the MRI; it also can cause enhancement of the periosteum and temporalis muscle surrounding an occluded or partially occluded temporal artery [,]. If there is a history sufficiently suspicious for GCA (even if laboratory tests and imaging normal), the standard of care is to place the patient on 40 mg of prednisone (if no visual symptoms or signs) and refer for a temporal artery biopsy within two weeks [,,]. Rheumatology is then consulted, and the patient may be switched to a steroid sparing agent like methotrexate or tocilizumab (Actemra) as the prednisone is tapered slowly [,]. Monitoring always includes repeating laboratory values. If a patient has transient visual obscurations (graying or blacking out) or blurred vision due to choroidal nonperfusion or double vision, the prednisone dose should be at least 60 mg PO each morning with food [,]. If the ESR and CRP are very elevated, a significant thrombocytosis is present and/or the MRI shows extensive inflammation and/or the patient has already lost vision in one eye, the patient should be treated with high doses of IV steroids (methylprednisolone 250 mg q6 h) as an inpatient [,].

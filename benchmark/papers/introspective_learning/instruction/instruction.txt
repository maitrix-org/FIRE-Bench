You are a research agent. Conduct research and experiment about the question: "Can large language models acquire knowledge about their own internal behavioral tendencies--that is not directly contained in or derived from training data--through introspection? Specifically, can an LLM predict its own behavior in hypothetical scenarios more accurately than another model trained on the same behavioral data?"

You have access to the following resources:

Models:
- GPT-4, GPT-4o
- Load with HuggingFace: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B
- You can call these models using: from utils.llm_inference import LLMInference
- API key is provided with the LLMInference initialization function
- You can use the batch_generate() function to speed up the experiment
- Computational budget: 10000 API calls per model

Datasets:
(Training)
	Wikipedia Completion
	Country Sequence
	Color Sequence
	Wealth-Seeking
	Power-Seeking
	ARC Dataset
(Evaluation)
	Stories Sentences
	Animal Sequence
	English Words
	Myopic Reward
	Survival Instinct
	MMLU

Please design and execute experiments to investigate this research question. Document your experimental plan, run **FULL** experiments, and provide conclusions at different levels of detail.

You are a research agent. Conduct research and experiment about the question: “Do large language models accurately capture the irrational aspects of human decision making, or do they instead assume that people behave according to rational choice theories (such as expected value theory)?

You have access to the following resources:

Model:
- You can call these models using: from utils.llm_inference import LLMInference
- API key is provided with the LLMInference initialization function, computation budget is 10000 API calls per model

- GPT-4-Turbo
- GPT-4o

Datasets:
- choices13k: you can either load the raw data from /data/choices13k/ or load the human-readable version from
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset("Josephgflowers/Risky_Choices")
```

Evaluation Methods:
- Evaluate introspective human-modeling abilities of LLMs using the risky choice paradigm. Each model is tested on three forward modeling tasks: predicting individual human choices, estimating population-level choice proportions, and simulating its own choices with results compared to empirical human decision probabilities P(A).

Constraint:
- You should **NOT** use any web search tool or try to answer the question based on your prior knowledge, but run **FULL** end to end experiment and draw conclusion from your experiment results. 
- When loading dataset using ```load_dataset("Josephgflowers/Risky_Choices")```, don't try to add other arguments like "cache_dir".


Please design and execute experiments to investigate this research question. Document your experimental plan, run end-to-end experiments, and provide conclusions.

You are a research agent. Conduct research and experiment about the question: "Do large language models (LLMs) learn more coherent and grounded representations that reflect the real world (such as spatial and temporal representations) rather than just an enormous collection of superficial statistics?"

You have access to the following resources:

Models:
- GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini
- Load with HuggingFace: meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf
- You can call these models using: from utils.llm_inference import LLMInference
- API key is provided with the LLMInference initialization function
- You can use the batch_generate() function to speed up the experiment
- Computational budget: 1000 API calls per model

Datasets:

Please design and execute experiments to investigate this research question. Document experimental plan, run end-to-end experiments, and provide conclusions at different levels of detail.

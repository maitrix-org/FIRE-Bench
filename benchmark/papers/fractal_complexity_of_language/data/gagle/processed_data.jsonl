{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00011-of-00064--684", "original_text": "On the morning of Nov. 20 last year, Tyrone Tomlin sat in the cage of one of the Brooklyn criminal courthouse’s interview rooms, a bare white cinder-block cell about the size of an office cubicle. Hardly visible through the heavy steel screen in front of him was Alison Stocking, the public defender who had just been assigned to his case. Tomlin, exhausted and frustrated, was trying to explain how he came to be arrested the afternoon before. It wasn’t entirely clear to Tomlin himself. Still in his work clothes, his boots encrusted with concrete dust, he recounted what had happened.\n\nThe previous afternoon, he was heading home from a construction job. Tomlin had served two short stints in prison on felony convictions for auto theft and selling drugs in the late ’80s and mid-’90s, but even now, grizzled with white stubble and looking older than his 53 years, he found it hard to land steady work and relied on temporary construction gigs to get by. Around the corner from his home in Crown Heights, the Brooklyn neighborhood where Tomlin has lived his entire life, he ran into some friends near the corner of Schenectady and Lincoln Avenues outside the FM Brothers Discount store, its stock of buckets, mops, backpacks and toilet paper overflowing onto the sidewalk. As he and his friends caught up, two plainclothes officers from the New York Police Department’s Brooklyn North narcotics squad, recognizable by the badges on their belts and their bulletproof vests, paused outside the store. At the time, Tomlin thought nothing of it. ‘‘I’m not doing anything wrong,’’ he remembers thinking. ‘‘We’re just talking.’’\n\nTomlin broke off to go inside the store and buy a soda. The clerk wrapped it in a paper bag and handed him a straw. Back outside, as the conversation wound down, one of the officers called the men over. He asked one of Tomlin’s friends if he was carrying anything he shouldn’t; he frisked him. Then he turned to Tomlin, who was holding his bagged soda and straw. ‘‘He thought it was a beer,’’ Tomlin guesses. ‘‘He opens the bag up, it was a soda. He says, ‘What you got in the other hand?’ I says, ‘I got a straw that I’m about to use for the soda.’ ’’ The officer asked Tomlin if he had anything on him that he shouldn’t. ‘‘I says, ‘No, you can check me, I don’t have nothing on me.’ He checks me. He’s going all through my socks and everything.’’ The next thing Tomlin knew, he says, he was getting handcuffed. ‘‘I said, ‘Officer, what am I getting locked up for?’ He says, ‘Drug paraphernalia.’ I says, ‘Drug paraphernalia?’ He opens up his hand and shows me the straw.’’\n\nStocking, an attorney with Brooklyn Defender Services, a public-defense office that represents 45,000 indigent clients a year, had picked up Tomlin’s case file a few minutes before interviewing him. The folder was fat, always a bad sign to a public defender. The documentation submitted by the arresting officer explained that his training and experience told him that plastic straws are ‘‘a commonly used method of packaging heroin residue.’’ The rest of the file contained Tomlin’s criminal history, which included 41 convictions, all of them, save the two decades-old felonies, for low-level nonviolent misdemeanors — crimes of poverty like shoplifting food from the corner store. With a record like that, Stocking told her client, the district attorney’s office would most likely ask the judge to set bail, and there was a good chance that the judge would do it. If Tomlin couldn’t come up with the money, he’d go to jail until his case was resolved.\n\nTheir conversation didn’t last long. On average, a couple of hundred cases pass through Brooklyn’s arraignment courtrooms every day, and the public defenders who handle the overwhelming majority of those cases rarely get to spend more than 10 minutes with each client before the defendant is called into court for arraignment. Before leaving, Stocking relayed what the assistant district attorney told her a few minutes earlier: The prosecution was prepared to offer Tomlin a deal. Plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance, serve 30 days on Rikers and be done with it. Tomlin said he wasn’t interested. A guilty plea would only add to his record and compound the penalties if he were arrested again. ‘‘They’re mistaken,’’ he told Stocking. ‘‘It’s a regular straw!’’ When the straw was tested by the police evidence lab, he assured her, it would show that he was telling the truth. In the meantime, there was no way he was pleading guilty to anything.\n\nWhen it was Tomlin’s turn in front of the judge, events unfolded as predicted: The assistant district attorney handling the case offered him 30 days for a guilty plea. After he refused, the A.D.A. asked for bail. The judge agreed, setting it at $1,500. Tomlin, living paycheck to paycheck, had nothing like that kind of money. ‘‘If it had been $100, I might have been able to get that,’’ he said afterward. As it was, less than 24 hours after getting off work, Tomlin was on a bus to Rikers Island, New York’s notorious jail complex, where his situation was about to get a lot worse.\n\n‘‘Criminal justice,’’ President Obama said in a speech to the N.A.A.C.P. last month, ‘‘is not as fair as it should be. Mass incarceration makes our country worse off, and we need to do something about it.’’ Two days after the speech, Obama became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison, meeting with convicts in a corrections institution in El Reno, Okla. The setting was dramatic, but mass incarceration isn’t actually a federal problem. Of the 2.2 million people currently locked up in this country, fewer than one in 10 is being held in a federal prison. Far more are serving time in state prisons, and nearly three-quarters of a million aren’t in prison at all but in local city and county jails. Of those in jails, 60 percent haven’t been convicted of anything. They’re innocent in the eyes of the law, awaiting resolution in their cases. Some of these inmates are being held because they’re considered dangerous or unlikely to return to court for their hearings. But many of them simply cannot afford to pay the bail that has been set.\n\nOccasionally, these cases make the news. In June, Sandra Bland was found dead in her cell in Texas after failing to come up with $500 for her release. But often, they go unnoticed. The federal government doesn’t track the number of people locked up because they can’t make bail. What we do know is that at any given time, close to 450,000 people are in pretrial detention in the United States — a figure that includes both those denied bail and those unable to pay the bail that has been set. Even that figure fails to capture the churn of local incarceration: In a given year, city and county jails across the country admit between 11 million and 13 million people. In New York City, where courts use bail far less than in many jurisdictions, roughly 45,000 people are jailed each year simply because they can’t pay their court-assigned bail. And while the city’s courts set bail much lower than the national average, only one in 10 defendants is able to pay it at arraignment. To put a finer point on it: Even when bail is set comparatively low — at $500 or less, as it is in one-third of nonfelony cases — only 15 percent of defendants are able to come up with the money to avoid jail.\n\nBail hasn’t always been a mechanism for locking people up. When the concept first took shape in England during the Middle Ages, it was emancipatory. Rather than detaining people indefinitely without trial, magistrates were required to let defendants go free before seeing a judge, guaranteeing their return to court with a bond. If the defendant failed to return, he would forfeit the amount of the bond. The bond might be secured — that is, with some or all of the amount of the bond paid in advance and returned at the end of the trial — or it might not. In 1689, the English Bill of Rights outlawed the widespread practice of keeping defendants in jail by setting deliberately unaffordable bail, declaring that ‘‘excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed.’’ The same language was adopted word for word a century later in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nBut as bail has evolved in America, it has become less and less a tool for keeping people out of jail, and more and more a trap door for those who cannot afford to pay it. Unsecured bond has become vanishingly rare, and in most jurisdictions, there are only two ways to make bail: post the entire amount yourself up front — what’s called ‘‘money bail’’ or ‘‘cash bail’’ — or pay a commercial bail bondsman to do so. For relatively low bail amounts — say, below $2,000, the range in which most New York City bails fall — the second option often doesn’t even exist; bondsmen can’t make enough money from such small bails to make it worth their while.\n\nWith national attention suddenly focused on the criminal-justice system, bail has been cited as an easy target for reformers. But ensuring that no one is held in jail based on poverty would, in many respects, necessitate a complete reordering of criminal justice. The open secret is that in most jurisdictions, bail is the grease that keeps the gears of the overburdened system turning. Faced with the prospect of going to jail for want of bail, many defendants accept plea deals instead, sometimes at their arraignments. New York City courts processed 365,000 arraignments in 2013; well under 5 percent of those cases went all the way to a trial resolution. If even a small fraction of those defendants asserted their right to a trial, criminal courts would be overwhelmed. By encouraging poor defendants to plead guilty, bail keeps the system afloat.\n\n‘‘What, did they arrest all of Brooklyn today?’’ one court officer asked another on a recent Sunday night in one of the two bustling arraignment courtrooms in Downtown Brooklyn. Defendants, a vast majority of them black, paraded past the judge in quick succession: Unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. Open container of alcohol in public. Marijuana possession. Riding a bicycle on the sidewalk. Misdemeanors, many of them minor, some aggravated by an outstanding bench warrant for failure to appear in court on another case, failure to complete court-ordered community service or failure to pay a fine. Hundreds of people were awaiting arraignment, first in central booking across the street, then in cells on the ninth floor and finally in a small communal cell called ‘‘the pen’’ behind the arraignment courtrooms on the ground floor. On this night, there were more than a dozen men in the cell waiting to see a lawyer, pacing, sitting on benches, crouching in corners.\n\nOne man called out from the pen, saying that there was dried excrement in there from the day before. ‘‘Nobody comes in here to clean!’’ he exclaimed. ‘‘It’s mad dirty!’’ A guard approached the bars and briefly sprayed a can of air freshener. Around the corner, the pen opened onto a series of booths, where, separated by heavy metal screens, the defendants met with their lawyers. Scott Hechinger, a senior trial attorney with Brooklyn Defender Services, picked up a stack of case files, quickly scanned the charges and rap sheets, stepped down a short hallway behind the courtroom and started calling names through the mesh screen. The first client was charged with criminal mischief after getting in an argument with his girlfriend and breaking some bowls. It was more complicated than that, he told Hechinger. She came home drunk, threw his clothes out the window. It escalated. He left. They arrested him across the street. Hechinger called the girlfriend and left a message. He called the client’s mother, whom the man lived with. If bail was set, how much could she afford? At most $250. Time’s up. Next case.\n\nA young man jumped a subway turnstile. Prosecutors were offering to make it go away and let him out that night if he did two days of community service and avoided being rearrested for the next six months. This one was easy. ‘‘Take the deal,’’ Hechinger said. It was better than paying a $120 fee.\n\nNext up was a homeless teenager, charged with ‘‘obstruction of governmental administration.’’ The paperwork said the police saw him with a knife, and that he resisted arrest. He said there was no knife, that the cops stopped him for no reason and beat him. He showed Hechinger bruises on his arms and a fat lip. It was hard to see much through the screen. Hechinger promised to take a closer look in a few minutes when they were in front of the judge together. The final person was a man arrested for driving with a suspended license, a straightforward case.\n\nAfter less than half an hour, Hechinger was back in the courtroom. The defendants he interviewed were marched out onto a bench against the left wall. First was the turnstile jumper. The prosecutor laid out the charges and the offer. The defendant took the deal and would have to complete community service. Next was the homeless teenager. The prosecutor asked for bail of $5,000. Hechinger argued that bail was unnecessary. The judge set it at $250. The teenager didn’t have it. He would be sleeping at Rikers. The guy with the suspended license was released on his own recognizance — without any bail — and would be due back in court in a couple of months. Next appeared the man who broke his girlfriend’s bowls. The prosecutor wanted bail set at $2,500. Hechinger argued that there was no reason to believe his client wouldn’t return to court on his own. The judge set it at $1,000. ‘‘Your honor, I called the mother, she said she could afford $250,’’ Hechinger said. ‘‘I’m sorry, counselor, that’s my bail decision,’’ the judge responded.\n\nAnother half-hour had elapsed. Hechinger went back to the case pile and picked up another stack. One of the three other defenders working the courtroom stepped up with her own cases. When court shut down for the night at 1 a.m., defendants were still waiting. They would stay in their cells and be arraigned when court started up again in the morning.\n\nThe sheer speed of the arraignment process makes it virtually impossible for the court to make informed decisions. Prosecutors have nothing to go on but a statement from the police and possibly a complaining witness, and defense lawyers know only what they’ve been able to glean from their brief interviews and perhaps a phone call or two. It’s in this hurried moment, at the very outset of a criminal case, before evidence has been weighed or even gathered, that a defendant’s freedom is decided. The stakes are high, and not only for the obvious reason that jail is an unpleasant and often dangerous place to be. A pretrial stretch in jail can unravel the lives of vulnerable defendants in significant ways.\n\nThe next hearing in Tyrone Tomlin’s drinking-straw case was scheduled for a week after his arraignment. He left the courthouse, was loaded onto a bus and crossed the narrow causeway that connects Queens to Rikers. Tomlin was assigned to the Anna M. Kross Center, one of 10 correctional facilities on the island.\n\nIncarcerated people rarely have nice things to say about the places where they’re locked up, but an investigation by the United States attorney’s office this year found ‘‘a deep-seated culture of violence’’ among Rikers guards, who reported using force against inmates more than 4,000 times last year. Violence among inmates is also pervasive. A Department of Corrections document obtained by The Daily News reported 108 stabbings and slashings in the last year. ‘‘That place is miserable,’’ Tomlin said. ‘‘It’s dangerous. It’s every man for himself. You could get abused, you could get raped, you could get extorted. That stuff is all around.’’\n\nHoused in a unit with more than 50 other prisoners, Tomlin tried to keep his head down, and he was able to get through a week without incident. Outside, his aunt worried about him. His employer had no idea where he was. On Nov. 25, he was back in court for a discovery hearing, during which prosecutors were supposed to turn over any relevant evidence. None was presented, but prosecutors repeated their offer for Tomlin to plead guilty. He still refused. ‘‘I wasn’t taking nothing, because I didn’t do nothing,’’ he says. His case was adjourned for another two weeks.\n\nTomlin’s willingness to hold out against the charges was unusual. Across the criminal-justice system, bail acts as a tool of compulsion, forcing people who would not otherwise plead guilty to do so. A 2012 report by the New York City Criminal Justice Agency, based on 10 years’ worth of criminal statistics, bears this out. In nonfelony cases in which defendants were not detained before their trials, either because no bail was set or because they were able to pay it, only half were eventually convicted. When defendants were locked up until their cases were resolved, the conviction rate jumped to 92 percent. This isn’t just anecdotal; a multivariate analysis found that even controlling for other factors, pretrial detention was the single greatest predictor of conviction. ‘‘The data suggest that detention itself creates enough pressure to increase guilty pleas,’’ the report concluded.\n\nStill awaiting a trial, Tomlin returned to Rikers and quickly got into trouble with a group of younger inmates while on the phone with his aunt. ‘‘A young guy tells me, ‘Yo, pop, you gotta get off the phone,’ ’’ he said. ‘‘I said, ‘I’m in the middle of an important call.’ He wanted me to just hang up.’’ Tomlin quickly realized he’d made a mistake. That evening, in the shower, he was jumped by a group of young men. ‘‘Most of the punches went to the side of my head and my eye,’’ he said. ‘‘I was tussling one and had to worry about the other three, there was blows coming from everywhere.’’ Punched, kicked and stomped, Tomlin received medical attention, his face monstrously misshapen, his left eye swollen shut. ‘‘You’d think I was Frankenstein’s brother or something,’’ he said.\n\nTomlin’s eye was still swollen shut on Dec. 10, three weeks after his arrest, when he returned to court. At this hearing, prosecutors handed over a report from the police laboratory, which had tested the drinking straw. At the top of the report, in bold, underlined capital letters, were the words ‘‘No Controlled Substance Identified, Notify District Attorney.’’\n\nThe report had been faxed to the district attorney on Nov. 25, the same day as Tomlin’s last court hearing and days before his beating. The key to his freedom had been sitting unexamined. Conceding that the case had unraveled, the prosecutor asked that the charges be dismissed. ‘‘The judge says, ‘Mr. Tomlin, this is your lucky day, you’re going home,’ ’’ Tomlin recalls. ‘‘I just left the courtroom, signed some papers and that was it.’’\n\nTomlin had lost three weeks of income, was subjected to brutal physical violence and missed Thanksgiving dinner with his family. But he resisted the pressure to plead guilty. His previous convictions all came from pleas, most of them made with bail looming over him. He knows the bitter Catch-22 of pleading guilty to get out of jail. ‘‘It feels great to go home,’’ he says. ‘‘Anybody’s happy to go home. But at the same time, it feels bad, because that’s more damage on your record.’’\n\nFor defendants who would fight their cases and maintain their innocence if they had the money, a guilty plea involves a ritual of court procedure that verges on the Kafkaesque:\n\n‘‘Your lawyer tells me you want to plead guilty to the charge. Is that correct?’’ the judge will ask. Yes, the defendant must reply.\n\n‘‘You understand that by your plea of guilty you are giving up certain trial rights?’’ Yes.\n\n‘‘The right to remain silent, the right to confront witnesses against you, the right to have the prosecutor prove your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt?’’ Yes, yes, yes.\n\nAnd then: ‘‘Are you pleading guilty freely and voluntarily, because you are in fact guilty?’’\n\nHechinger, the lawyer with Brooklyn Defender Services, hates this part of the process. ‘‘A lot of times, at that last question, you feel the client beside you bristle,’’ he says. ‘‘Everyone in the room knows it’s not ‘freely and voluntarily.’ They’re making a decision coerced by money. In many cases, if they had money, they wouldn’t be pleading. But they put their heads down, and they say, ‘Yes.’ It’s a horrible, deflating feeling.’’\n\nThe long-term damage that bail inflicts on vulnerable defendants extends well beyond incarceration. Disappearing into the machinery of the justice system separates family members, interrupts work and jeopardizes housing. ‘‘Most of our clients are people who have crawled their way up from poverty or are in the throes of poverty,’’ Hechinger says. ‘‘Our clients work in service-level positions where if you’re gone for a day, you lose your job. People in need of caretaking — the elderly, the young — are left without caretakers. People who live in shelters, where if they miss their curfews, they lose their housing. Folks with immigration concerns are quicker to be put on the immigration radar. So when our clients have bail set, they suffer on the inside, they worry about what’s happening on the outside, and when they get out, they come back to a world that’s more difficult than the already difficult situation that they were in before.’’\n\nThis spring, a 24-year-old woman named Adriana found herself newly single in New York, trying to make a life for herself and her daughter. Short and round, with oversize glasses that frequently slide off her nose, she has an easy manner and deadpan sense of humor that belie her past as a runaway from an abusive mother. Adriana arrived in New York in the middle of 2014 with her baby daughter, not yet 2, and knew no one but her boyfriend at the time, a controlling figure who lived off her earnings from massages she advertised on Craigslist. (Like many runaways, Adriana had sometimes relied on sex work to survive, though recently she was trying to avoid it.) After separating from her boyfriend, Adriana managed to secure a spot in a Brooklyn shelter for victims of domestic violence. ‘‘I was trying to get a job, trying to get my life together,’’ she says. She was focused on her daughter. ‘‘I just want to be the best mother for her that I can be,’’ she says. ‘‘That’s my priority. That’s my only priority.’’ (Because of safety concerns, Adriana asked not to be identified by her full name.)\n\nOn the night of March 18, Adriana realized she was running low on diapers. A friend at the shelter who also had a child agreed to keep an eye on her daughter, and Adriana headed to a nearby Target. This was after curfew, and when a staff member saw Adriana leaving without her daughter, she called the police. ‘‘When I got to Target, I started getting all these texts from my friend,’’ Adriana says. ‘‘She was saying, ‘You’ve got to get back here — there are staff in your room, and they won’t let me in to look after the baby.’ ’’ Adriana rushed home with the diapers. In the shelter’s courtyard, she was met by police officers, who had her daughter.\n\n‘‘Where are you going with my baby?’’ she asked, according to court documents. ‘‘That’s my baby. I just went to the store to buy diapers.’’ It didn’t matter. The police placed her under arrest, charging her with endangering the welfare of a child. She gave one of the officers the diapers she’d just bought, in case her daughter needed to be changed. She was handcuffed and taken to the precinct. The police took her daughter to the station, too, where she was turned over to the city’s Administration for Children’s Services and eventually placed in a foster home.\n\nBefore her arraignment two days later, Adriana explained to her public defender what happened. Her friend could confirm that she was looking after the baby, she said. The lawyer told Adriana she’d do her best to get her released on her own recognizance. But when Adriana appeared in front of Judge Rosemarie Montalbano, the assistant district attorney asked for bail to be set at $5,000. Adriana had no criminal record and had never failed to make a court appearance, but the prosecutor cited an ‘‘A.C.S. history,’’ meaning that Adriana and her daughter had previous contact with the Administration for Children’s Services. This was true but misleading. The A.C.S. report involving Adriana had found that she wasn’t responsible for any neglect or abuse. What the A.C.S. did find was violence and coercion on the part of her boyfriend; this is how Adriana landed a spot in the domestic-violence shelter.\n\nBut arraignments happen quickly. Just as there was no time to track down Adriana’s friend to confirm that her daughter hadn’t been left unsupervised, there was no time to find out what the A.C.S. order actually said. The judge set bail at $1,500. Adriana’s public defender couldn’t believe it. ‘‘Judge, I’m going to ask you to state the reason for setting bail in this case,’’ she said, according to the court transcript. ‘‘Thank you, counsel,’’ was the judge’s only reply.\n\nWith no way to come up with $1,500, Adriana spent the next two weeks on Rikers Island. Her bail made it harder for her to fight her case, but it also effectively dismantled the new life she was trying to build for herself and her daughter. She lost her bed at the shelter, and her child was living with strangers. ‘‘It feels like they were kicking me when I was down,’’ she says.\n\nOver subsequent hearings, Adriana’s lawyers tried to get her bail lifted, but they ran into another common problem facing defendants: Once a judge sets bail, other judges are often reluctant to second-guess their colleague’s decision. If they free a defendant who commits a crime while out on bail, the blowback from politicians, police unions and the tabloid press can be substantial. ‘‘I have no idea what motivated Judge Montalbano to set bail,’’ said Judge Andrew Borrok at one of Adriana’s hearings, four days after her arraignment. Still, he said, ‘‘I’m not inclined to change what’s been done.’’\n\nAdriana’s lawyers managed to move her case to a court that specialized in sex-trafficking cases, hoping for a more sympathetic judge and prosecutors. In the trafficking court, however, prosecutors remained reluctant to lift bail, now citing concerns that Adriana’s safety could be at risk if her ex-boyfriend found out she was set free. Ultimately, after two weeks of hearings, prosecutors agreed to remove Adriana’s bail provided she complete weekly ‘‘life-skills coursework’’ administered by a group that serves arrested sex workers. ‘‘Congratulations on being in a place where a lot of people care about you,’’ Adriana remembers the judge telling her as she stood before him in handcuffs, quietly asking a court officer to push her glasses back up her nose. ‘‘There’s a lot of people in this room that want good things to happen to you. The fear is that you’re not ready for all of these great things.’’\n\nThe judge ordered Adriana released. She could begin reassembling her life, finding a new shelter, retrieving whatever remained of her possessions. But her baby was still in foster care, and her case still wasn’t resolved. In June, a judge finally agreed to dismiss her case if she wasn’t arrested for the next six months. As this story went to press, five months after her arrest, she was still fighting in family court to regain custody of her daughter.\n\nOutside the courtroom after the hearing for her release, Scott Hechinger, who helped coordinate Adriana’s defense, was exasperated. ‘‘Remember,’’ he said, ‘‘this is all about some diapers! Bail changes the conversation. If bail hadn’t been set, Adriana wouldn’t have to be negotiating to get out of Rikers. She’d just be released.’’\n\nIn early 2013, Jonathan Lippman, chief judge of the State of New York, decided that the business-as-usual approach to setting bail could not be tolerated any longer. ‘‘We still have a long way to go before we can claim that we have established a coherent, rational approach to pretrial justice,’’ he said in his annual State of the Judiciary address. ‘‘Incarcerating indigent defendants for no other reason than that they cannot meet even a minimum bail amount strips our justice system of its credibility and distorts its operation.’’ Lipp­man sent a package of proposed legislation to reduce the reliance on cash bail to lawmakers in Albany, and he lobbied for the reforms hard in the press. His efforts went nowhere. ‘‘Zero,’’ Lippman says, shaking his head. ‘‘Nothing.’’ Lawmakers had no appetite for bail reform.\n\nTwo years later, that may be changing. This summer, the New York City Council took a tentative step toward reform by earmarking $1.4 million for a citywide fund to bail out low-level offenders. The fund, proposed with much fanfare by Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito in her State of the City address in February, is modeled on a number of smaller bail funds around the city. The oldest of these, the Bronx Freedom Fund, was established in 2007 in association with the Bronx Defenders, a public-defender organization. The founders shut down the fund after only a year and a half, after a judge argued that it was effectively operating as an unlicensed bail-bond business. But before they did, the fund bailed out nearly 200 defendants and generated some illuminating statistics. Ninety-six percent of the fund’s clients made it to every one of their court appearances, a return rate higher even than that of people who posted their own bail. More than half of the Freedom Fund’s clients, now able to fight their cases outside jail, saw their charges completely dismissed. Not a single client went to jail on the charges for which bail had been posted. By comparison, defendants held on bail for the duration of their cases were convicted 92 percent of the time. The numbers showed what everyone familiar with the system already knew anecdotally: Bail makes poor people who would otherwise win their cases plead guilty.\n\nArmed with these statistics, as well as a 2010 Human Rights Watch report that calculated that New York City was paying $42 million a year to incarcerate nonfelony defendants, the Freedom Fund’s founders managed to persuade state lawmakers to pass legislation explicitly legalizing nonprofit bail funds. In 2013, the Freedom Fund resumed operation. Close behind was the Brooklyn Community Bail Fund, begun by Scott Hechinger and a colleague at Brooklyn Defender Services. It was opened this spring and has already bailed out more than 60 clients.\n\nBut even the staunchest supporters of bail funds are quick to say that they are, at best, temporary Band-Aids for a broken system. ‘‘They are a useful form of relief as long as people are being locked up because they’re poor,’’ says Hechinger, who is no longer affiliated with the Brooklyn bail fund. ‘‘They’re an intervention for an urgent need. But they’re not actual bail reform.’’\n\nEarlier this summer, in the wake of the shocking suicide of Kalief Browder, a Bronx teenager arrested on suspicion of stealing a backpack and held on bail for three years in Rikers before his case was dismissed, Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled his own initiative. ‘‘I wish, I deeply wish, we hadn’t lost him — but he did not die in vain,’’ de Blasio said. The centerpiece of de Blasio’s initiative is a $17.8 million citywide initiative based on pilot programs that have been running in Queens and Manhattan, offering something called ‘‘supervised release.’’ Under these programs, a small number of qualifying defendants, who might otherwise be held on bail, are instead set free and required to check in with caseworkers by phone and in person. The pilot programs have shown good results, but they have narrowly tailored eligibility requirements. Tyrone Tomlin, for example, would not have been eligible because he had too many previous convictions. Kalief Browder would not have been eligible, either, because the crime he was accused of, stealing a backpack, was charged as second-degree robbery, a violent felony. ‘‘If Kalief Browder’s death wasn’t in vain,’’ says Peter Goldberg, executive director of the Brooklyn Community Bail Fund, ‘‘it won’t be because of the proposals we’ve seen so far from the city.’’\n\nThe only truly meaningful reform, many observers agree, is to take money out of the bail process entirely. Lippman has been championing this idea for several years. ‘‘You have to eliminate cash bail,’’ he says. The ramifications of such a move are far-reaching. Without bail — and the quick guilty pleas that it produces — courts would come under significant strain. ‘‘The system would shut down,’’ Goldberg says. ‘‘A lot of the 250 people who were waiting to be arraigned in Brooklyn last night would all be coming back to court soon to go forward with a trial for a misdemeanor that no one has any interest in pursuing.’’ This crisis, Goldberg believes, would be a good thing. ‘‘You want pressure on the system. You want everyone involved to be reconsidering. Because of how much it could clog the system, you might have people on high telling cops to stop picking people up for an open-container violation, because ‘I don’t want to deal with it in my courtroom.’ ’’\n\nThe idea of eliminating cash bail is hardly unprecedented. When Washington overhauled its bail system in the 1980s and ’90s, it instituted a supervised-release program and other measures designed to reduce the number of people held on bail. But judges continued to set bail until the law was rewritten to effectively forbid the imprisonment of people on financial grounds. The number of people locked up on bail plummeted. ‘‘D.C. had all the tools in place,’’ says Cherise Fanno Burdeen, executive director of the Pretrial Justice Institute. ‘‘They just needed a way to change the court culture.’’ Kentucky, Colorado and, last year, New Jersey have joined Washington in adopting legislation severely curtailing bail’s use.\n\nThe more modest reforms being proposed in New York City, Goldberg says, are hardly cause for celebration. ‘‘Robert Kennedy, when he was attorney general, raised exactly the concerns with bail we’re talking about now,’’ he says. ‘‘Fifty years later, we’re still having the conversation. We can’t be satisfied with cosmetic fixes. And the truth is, even meaningful bail reform is just the beginning. The real work is asking why we’re arresting so many people on low-level offenses in the first place, and why so many of them come from poor black and brown communities. Bail is easy.’’\n\nIn late June, Tyrone Tomlin sat at a picnic table in St. John’s Park in Crown Heights, trying to cool down after a hot day of work and sipping bodega iced tea through a straw. Beneath his baseball cap, his left eye still looked askew, his gaze unfocused and hard to meet. ‘‘My sight is still a little blurry,’’ he said. ‘‘I still feel the aftereffects. Pains in my eye, in my head.’’ The whole situation could have been worse, he knows. He could have been hurt more seriously at Rikers. He could have been fired from his construction job, after being a no-show for the better part of a month while locked up. But even so, he was still angry about what happened last winter. ‘‘I’m not no prince,’’ he acknowledged. ‘‘But I got a raw deal.’’\n\nThe inability to make bail has been a virtual constant in Tomlin’s life. His first encounter with the law came when he was 14 or 15 — he recalls being picked up on a robbery charge and sent to Spofford juvenile detention center in the Bronx because his family couldn’t pay bail. After a few months, he says, he pleaded guilty and received probation. ‘‘They said it’s supposed to teach you a lesson,’’ he said. ‘‘It just got me worse.’’ In two-thirds of the times he has pleaded guilty to misdemeanors in the last 14 years, he did so either at arraignment to avoid being sent to Rikers or after already spending as much as two weeks at Rikers. Not once has he been able to pay bail.\n\n“I’m not Johnny Rich-Kid with a silver spoon,” he says. For Tomlin, the historical evolutions of bail and pretrial jurisprudence are abstractions without meaning in his life. Bail is simply a feature of the landscape, the thing that means he is locked up when someone with more money wouldn’t be. ‘‘Sure, yeah, I’m mad about it,’’ he said grudgingly. ‘‘But that’s the way it is. I’ve got to accept it. It’s not right, but it’s the way it is.’’ He shrugged. ‘‘What are you going to do?’’\n\nNick Pinto is a freelance journalist living in Brooklyn.

That left the “Sex and the City” star three points ahead of two of the other Season 8 front-runners—singer Lil’ Kim and gymnast Shawn Johnson—and four points ahead of “Bachelor” dumpee Melissa Rycroft. (Steve-O of “Jackass,” working without the safety net that was Steve Wozniak, hit bottom this week.)\n\nLest viewers assume that Gilles was a shoo-in to win the season after his perfect score of 30 last week, host Tom Bergeron considerately pointed out that in season 5, Sabrina Bryan, who was in the audience tonight, had posted an early perfect score but had been sent home early because of low viewer votes. Judging by the studio audience’s ecstatic reaction to Gilles’ paso doble tonight with partner Cheryl Burke, that outcome seems unlikely, and it’s currently hard to imagine anyone else catching up with him this season.\n\nRELATED: 'Dancing With the Stars': The Judges' Scorecards\n\nPerhaps the producers could even things out by forcing Gilles to dance to music that’s completely at odds with the spirit or even the rhythm of the genre he’s assigned, as they did this week to Melissa and to Ty Murray, with predictably bad results.\n\nThe first song selection, Rascal Flatts’ “Feels Like Today,” worked well enough for the elegantly choreographed Viennese waltz by country singer Chuck Wicks and his partner, Julianne Hough. During rehearsal, Julianne had demonstrated to her boyfriend the difference between moving your arm like a professional dancer and moving it like a student. (The moment was a little reminiscent of those times on “America’s Next Top Model” when Tyra Banks shows her pupils the difference between posing “high fashion” and posing “hoochie.”) Sadly, in their performance, Chuck did the move like a student, and throughout he lacked in grace and polish.\n\nThe male judges saw a big improvement: Len Goodman praised Chuck for having “come out of hibernation,” and Bruno Tonioli said, “Check [he probably meant “Chuck”], you’re emerging from the shadows of beautiful Julianne.” Carrie Ann Inaba, however, called the couple on a questionable lift (big surprise), and said that Chuck was failing to live up to his potential. “It’s irritating to me,” she added, prompting Bruno to cut in with “You’re irritating to me!” and her to reply, “You’re irritating to me!” and both of them to start talking over each other. “I’m already liking this night,” said host Tom Bergeron with a big grin.\n\nBackstage, hostess Samantha Harris pointed out that Chuck had ended the routine on bended knee, asking him, “Anything we should know?” “No,” said Chuck. Fortunately, he and Julianne both laughed. The judges’ scores—8’s from the guys, 7 from Carrie—should keep the couple happy enough.\n\nIn his taped segment, Lawrence Taylor said his general problem with the music is that it’s hard for him to keep the beat when he doesn’t know the words to the song. Ever obliging, the producers made him dance his paso doble to an instrumental. Though he promised to bring to the dance the same intensity he brought to football, he instead made us wonder if he was always a step behind when he played defense and if he always paused for a half step before making a big move.\n\nThe judges erred on the side of kindness, all finding something nice to say. “What have we got here?” said Bruno. “The prince of darkness. Strong, fearsome and powerful.” Carrie Ann, after noting Lawrence’s “lack of musicality,” said, “The intensity was there.”\n\n“The dance quality’s not quite there,” said Len, “but much better. Your best dance so far.” (Len gave Lawrence a 5 last week, so that’s not saying much.)\n\nApropos of nothing, Lawrence told Samantha backstage that his golf buddies back in Florida are now saying that if they beat him, he has to do a lap dance for them. Fortunately for him and them, he may not be going home soon; his score from the judges was up one point from last week, with Carrie Ann giving him a 6, Len a “seVEN!” and Bruno a 7.\n\n(Note: Longtime “DWTS” fans may be forgiven if they think that the paso doble—the so-called dance of the bullfight—was just made up in season 1 so John “J. Peterman” O’Hurley would have something to do with those eyebrows. But in fact, a Google or YouTube search will produce evidence that the dance existed before then.)\n\nComing off bad marks last week for including too many gymnastics tricks in their routine, Shawn Johnson and Mark Ballas danced a very traditional waltz full of classic moves that one might assume would have pleased the very traditionalist Len, ending in a blatant lift that one might assume would have angered the lift-phobic Carrie Ann. Wrong on both counts. Len criticized Shawn because she didn’t step forward on her heels, which is evidently a requirement in the Viennese waltz. (Usually, the judges dock the stars points for “heel leads.”)\n\nUpon being booed roundly, Len said, “Why do I get that? I’m a stranger in this country. I get booed for telling the truth.” “We all agree,” said Tom. “You’re very strange in this country.”\n\nStranger still, Carrie Ann forgave the lift because it was the couple’s “artistic finish.” (Are ballroom rules so complicated that we’re still learning new details after eight seasons, or are the judges just making this stuff up as they go along?) She praised Shawn and Mark for keeping it simple. Bruno, agreeing with Carrie Ann about the simplicity, matched her score of 9, while fussy old Len came up with an 8. Oddly, the total score was only one point higher than last week’s, further evidence that it’s probably best not to pay too close attention to anything the judges say.\n\nSince Melissa Rycroft was going to be performing the intense paso doble, her big problem this week was losing what she called “the big cheesy grin” she’d had to keep glued to her face during all of her previous routines. (Could all that smiling be losing her sympathy votes from her “Bachelor” fans?) Much of Melissa and Tony Dovolani’s rehearsal footage showed him trying to wipe that grin off her face.\n\nThe producers helped in that effort by saddling the couple with the totally inapt “Poker Face,” by Lady GaGa. The lack of connection between the music and the dance was so great that you were tempted to call the cable company and say that you were getting audio from a different channel. (This happens all too often on “DWTS.”) Even when Melissa and Tony were on the beat, they seemed off. (To add to the confusion, Melissa was wearing flamenco clothes and Bollywood makeup.)\n\nThe judges rightly praised the dramatic choreography but said there were some mistakes. Bruno, the most enthusiastic, said, “Melissa, or should I say Carmen, the ballsy heartbreaker, you went for it in an extremely difficult routine.” He gave her a 9 to the other judges’ 8’s, leaving Melissa a full four points lower than last week.\n\nAnother odd song choice, Screaming Jay Hawkins’ “I Put a Spell on You,” actually kind of worked for David Alan Grier and Kym Johnson’s waltz. Or at least it wasn’t the worst thing about the performance. As the judges pointed out, David and Kym failed to connect, and David’s solo moves were painful to watch. Being kind (and, as usual, going for the wordplay), Bruno said, “David, the spell worked—at times,” but added, “You lift a leg, you looked like a dog at a lamppost.” Len praised Kym’s choreography for telling a story (although he didn’t hazard a guess as to what that story was). Accordingly, he gave the couple an 8 to the other judges’ 7’s.\n\nConversely, Len was the only negative in Gilles Marini and Cheryl Burke’s paso doble, a performance that fans will still be YouTubing years from now. The segment started with a filler-friendly visit to a martial-arts center so Gilles could show off his skills and his cute son, who squeaked, “You’re going down, Papa!” (To make it more adorable, the kid put the accent on the second syllable in Papa.) Teasing his performance, Gilles told the camera, “You’ve seen me love, you’ve seen me intense, now get ready to see me fight.”\n\nSince Maksim Chmerkovskiy is out of the picture, it’s now safe for other men to rock the bare-chested-but-belly-button-covered look on “DWTS.” So Gilles came on stage wearing nothing but shoes and tight, very high-waisted black trousers, posing dramatically until Cheryl slipped a sequined bolero jacket on him. Dancing to a spot-on arrangement of the “Habanera” from “Carmen” (a.k.a. that song you know from “Carmen”), the couple brought more drama in one routine than we’d seen all night. Gilles was in command throughout, even when he was just standing and letting her do all the work. He even brought some flamenco flavor, performing high-speed foot stomps. The routine ended with Gilles delivering the coup de grace to Cheryl’s chest; in the overhead shot, she actually looked afraid.\n\nBruno and Carrie Ann joined the audience in the standing ovation. “It almost brought me to tears, it was so passionate,” said Carrie Ann. “Didn’t you find it a tad hectic in places?” said Len, who went on to praise the routine’s passion, but added, “I wasn’t crazy about the top off.” (Whereupon the women in the crowd squealed, and Tom accused Len of “pec envy.”) “Gilles, you’re going in for the kill,” rhymed Bruno, who then recapped: “The sexual tension was at the snapping point. Will he? Will she? Who’s gonna end on top? And then the kill! You nailed it!” Appropriately, Len’s 9 got booed.\n\nIf they hadn’t had such a hard act to follow, Steve-O and Lacey Schwimmer probably would have failed to impress anyway. The best part of their segment was the appearance by Steve-O’s “Jackass” colleagues Johnny Knoxville, Wee Man and Jeff Tremaine. Playing the triumph-over-drugs card, Knoxville said to Steve, “You have already won, because a year ago you probably had a couple weeks to live, honestly.” The brief shot of Steve-O and Wee Man dancing was more enjoyable than what followed.\n\nTrying to appeal to the dozens of mime fans in the viewing audience, Steve-O was dressed like Marcel Marceau (sans whiteface) and started the routine by pretending to pull Lacey toward him on a rope. The rest of their waltz was sedate and, on Steve’s part, graceless without being particularly awkward. It was all reminiscent of a dutiful groom at his wedding. The problem is that whereas the dutiful groom knows this is the last time he’ll ever have to dance, we don’t know how many more times we’ll have to watch Steve-O. The accompanying song was largely unidentifiable; it’s possible that the vocalist was just making up French-sounding syllables.\n\nThe judges were diplomatic. “Don’t get overexcited,” said Len, “but it was your best dance.” “You deed very well, my darling,” said Bruno in a French accent. (If he can speak English with a French accent, why can’t he speak it with an American accent?) Carrie Ann said she liked the sweetness Steve brought to the routine, although she doesn’t usually like acting on the dancefloor. The judges gave Steve straight 6’s.\n\nTy Murray was all excited about doing the dance of the bullfight, because, being a rodeo performer, he’s used to “accounting for the bull’s moves.” As filler, he and partner Chelsie Hightower went to a ranch and sat on a bull in a gate for a few moments. “You’ll be as close to being a bull rider,” he told her, “as I am to being a dancer.”\n\nTo make sure Ty didn’t make any progress in that direction, the producers chose to accompany his paso doble with Heart’s “Barracuda.” He vainly stomped around, trying to find a beat to go along with the Latin moves. The judges attributed the awkwardness to overthinking. “I thought I was seeing a Transformer doing the paso doble,” said Bruno. Len said that at least it was better than Ty’s cha-cha from week 1. (Len can’t seem to shake that memory.) Bruno and Carrie Ann gave the routine a 7; Len gave it a “seVEN!”\n\nLil’ Kim’s handicap this week was rehearsing while doing a video and photo shoot. The tension was so great that she had to be bleeped in rehearsal, although she blurted out later that she had been calming herself by drawing on her Buddha Board. (Was that a paid plug? If yes, does mentioning it here qualify us for a payment?)\n\nKim’s waltz wasn’t quite nirvana. Derek Hough is a very supportive partner, slowing down or speeding up to cover Kim’s minor mistakes, but he can’t help outshining her. If you could keep your eyes on her, you saw a graceful, capable performance.\n\nCarrie Ann said she felt like Kim’s mom, proud that she did so well. Len, however, said he felt like her podiatrist, because he couldn’t stop looking at her feet—those bad non-heel leads again! Tom segued to Bruno by quipping, “As they say in podiatry, let’s look for some corn.” Bruno sort of came through, telling Len, “If you’re always looking at her feet, there’s something wrong with you, because there’s plenty to look.” Kim couldn’t quite decide whether to appear flattered, amused or offended. Carrie Ann and Bruno gave her 9’s; foot fetishist Len gave her an 8.\n\nAs Tom kept reminding us, the dance-off is coming back on Tuesday’s elimination show. Steve-O is an obvious pick for the bottom two; of the other near-bottom dwellers, David Alan Grier and Lawrence Taylor are the least fun to watch, or at least to root for. But the viewers have been full of surprises so far this season, so it’s anyone’s game to lose.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nSince the two dance genres on last night’s “Dancing With the Stars” were the dramatic paso doble and Viennese waltz, it was perhaps inevitable that actor Gilles Marini would come out on top again, earning a near-perfect score of 29."}

Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Lauren Moore ordered Castro held on $8 million bond -- $2 million for each of the three women and the child born to Amanda Berry before they were freed Monday evening.\n\nHours later, the top prosecutor in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, announced he'd press for more charges -- \"for each and every act of sexual violence ... each day of kidnapping, every felonious assault (and) all his attempted murders.\"\n\nFurthermore, Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said he'd try to persuade a grand jury to indict the 52-year-old Castro for \"aggravated murder\" for the termination of his captives' pregnancies. He cited a state law that a person can be charged with murder -- a conviction that could lead to the death penalty in Ohio -- for killing unborn children.\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nKidnapped teens found decade later\n\nCNN Exclusive: 'We don't have monster in our blood'\n\nAccording to an initial incident report obtained by CNN, Michelle Knight said she became pregnant at least five times while in Castro's 1,400-square-foot home. When that happened, she told investigators, Castro \"starved her for at least two weeks, then he repeatedly punched her in the stomach until she miscarried.\"\n\nIt is not known how many times, if any, the other two women got pregnant only to miscarry. One of them, Berry, gave birth to a daughter while in captivity.\n\nThat's just one of the brutal tales reported so far about the women's captivity, which McGinty described as \"beyond comprehension.\"\n\n\"The child kidnapper operated a torture chamber and private prison in the heart of the city,\" he told reporters. \"The horrific brutality and torture that the victims endured for a decade is beyond comprehension.\"\n\nCastro's own mother is among those trying to make sense of the horror.\n\n\"I have a sick son who has done something serious,\" she told Univision and Telemundo. \"I'm suffering very much. I ask for forgiveness from those mothers; may those girls forgive me.\"\n\nSource: Writings detail actions, reasons behind them\n\nSo what was going through the suspect's mind, when he allegedly lured three women into a car between 2002 and 2004, took them to his home three miles away and held them there -- where they were chained, threatened and repeatedly sexually assaulted?\n\nNeither Castro, his attorneys nor police have spelled out a motive publicly.\n\nThe suspect has talked with investigators, confessing to some of the actions of which he's accused, said a law enforcement source closely involved with the investigation. The source did not describe precisely what Castro confessed to when he was interrogated.\n\nPlus, investigators have asked the state crime lab to expedite tests to create a DNA profile of Castro -- something that typically takes 20 days, but should be back Friday -- said Ohio Attorney General's office spokesman Dan Tierney.\n\nThey're also poring over evidence, including more than 200 items seized from Castro's Seymour Avenue home. Among them are writings authorities believe were written by the suspect, said two law enforcement sources closely involved in the case.\n\nThose contain \"specific detailing of actions and reasons behind actions\" tied to the women's abduction and their kidnapper's behavior toward them, one of the law enforcement sources said. The author cites his own history of abuse by family members as justification.\n\nThe latest developments in the Cleveland case\n\nThe source -- who described the \"pretty lengthy\" writings as \"more of a diary\" -- said they included talk of suicide, though that's just one of many aspects.\n\nAuthorities are working \"meticulously\" to see whether others were involved in the kidnapping plot. Two of Castro's brothers, Pedro and Onil, were initially arrested in the case only to be released Thursday -- after appearing in court on unrelated cases -- when investigators found nothing, including from the victims' interviews, linking them to the abductions.\n\nOne of his daughters, Angie Gregg, told CNN that she \"just wanted to die\" upon hearing her father had been implicated.\n\nBut looking back, she thinks there were signs of something awry -- such as how her father \"kept his house locked down so tight\" and would sometimes leave mysteriously for an hour or so, then return, with \"no explanation.\"\n\n\"Everything's making sense now,\" Gregg said. \"It's all adding up, and I'm just disgusted.\"\n\nSource: Death threat if newborn died\n\nAccording to the initial incident report, the women said Castro first chained them in the basement but later let them live upstairs on the second floor.\n\nThe women went outside only twice during their ordeal -- and just \"briefly\" at that, Cleveland Public Safety Director Martin Flask said.\n\nMost of the time the three would be in different rooms, though they interacted occasionally and came to \"rely on each other for survival,\" said a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation.\n\nOne thing they could count on was that their alleged captor wouldn't let them out.\n\nCastro would often test his captives by pretending to leave, the law enforcement source said. Then he'd suddenly return; if there were indications any of the women had moved, they'd be disciplined.\n\nSurvival the key difference from 'House of Horrors' case\n\nWhile Knight told investigators Castro forced her to miscarry her own unborn children, she said he ordered her to deliver Berry's child, according to a police source familiar with the investigation.\n\nThe baby was delivered in a plastic tub or pool in order to contain the afterbirth and amniotic fluid, the source said.\n\nPanic ensued soon after. The child stopped breathing, and everyone started screaming, the source said, citing accounts by the young women.\n\nKnight said Castro threatened to kill her if the baby did not survive, the initial police report states.\n\n\"What's most incredible here is that this girl who knows nothing about childbirth was able to deliver a baby that is now a healthy 6-year-old,\" the source said.\n\n'I don't think she would have lived very much longer'\n\nKnight remained hospitalized in good condition Thursday, said MetroHealth Medical Center spokeswoman Tina Shaerban-Arundel.\n\nThe others held -- Berry, her 6-year-old daughter and Georgina \"Gina\" DeJesus -- are back with relatives.\n\nFBI specialists who talked with them feel they \"desperately need space and time,\" said McGinty.\n\nWho are Berry, DeJesus and Knight?\n\n\"These victims need to be decompressed,\" he said. \"They need a chance to heal before we seek further in-depth evidence from them.\"\n\nThose close to them, as well as residents of Cleveland and beyond, are trying to make sense of the alleged depravity.\n\nOne of them is Arlene Castro, the suspect's daughter and once a very good friend of DeJesus. She was interviewed on an \"America's Most Wanted\" segment in 2005 talking about how she'd been with DeJesus, hoping to spend the afternoon with her, shortly before her abduction.\n\nSpeaking Thursday on ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" she said she last spoke with her father late last month, adding the two had never been close. Whatever their relationship, she insisted, \"I had no idea\" what was happening.\n\n\"I'm really disappointed, embarrassed, mainly devastated,\" Arlene Castro said. \"... I would like to say that I'm absolutely so, so sorry.\"\n\nWomen crushed by news her father allegedly abducted her friend\n\nFern Gentry said on CNN's \"Starting Point\" Thursday that hearing Berry, her granddaughter, was alive 10 years after her disappearance was the \"most important thing that ever happened in my life.\"\n\nGentry, who spoke to Berry by phone from her Tennessee home Tuesday, said she's grateful for all involved in the case -- from police to helpful neighbors -- and that her granddaughter can now live her life.\n\n\"If she hadn't got out, I don't think she would have lived very much longer,\" Gentry said.\n\nTimeline: From missing to liberated\n\nCNN's Pamela Brown reported from Cleveland, and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00000-of-00064--169", "original_text": "In April 2012, a Kansas SWAT team raided the home of Robert and Addie Harte, their 7-year-old daughter and their 13-year-old son. The couple, both former CIA analysts, awoke to pounding at the door. When Robert Harte answered, SWAT agents flooded the home. He was told to lie on the floor. When Addie Harte came out to see what was going on, she saw her husband on his stomach as SWAT cop stood over him with a gun. The family was then held at gunpoint for more than two hours while the police searched their home. Though they claimed to be looking for evidence of a major marijuana growing operation, they later stated that they knew within about 20 minutes that they wouldn’t find any such operation. So they switched to search for evidence of “personal use.” They found no evidence of any criminal activity.\n\nThe investigation leading to the raid began at least seven months earlier, when Robert Harte and his son went to a gardening store to purchase supplies to grow hydroponic tomatoes for a school project. A state trooper had been positioned in the store parking lot to collect the license plate numbers of customers, compile them into a spreadsheet, then send the spreadsheets to local sheriff’s departments for further investigation. Yes, merely shopping at a gardening store could make you the target of a criminal drug investigation.\n\nMore than half a year later, the Johnson County Sheriff’s Department began investigating the Hartes as part of “Operation Constant Gardener,” basically a PR stunt in which the agency conducts multiple pot raids on April 20, or “4/20.” On several occasions, the Sheriff’s Department sent deputies out to sort through the family’s garbage. (The police don’t need a warrant to sift through your trash.) The deputies repeatedly found “saturated plant material” that they thought could possibly be marijuana. On two occasions, a drug testing field kit inexplicably indicated the presence of THC, the active drug in marijuana. It was on the basis of those tests and Harte’s patronage of a gardening store that the police obtained the warrant for the SWAT raid.\n\n[Meet Jay Via: One bad cop, in one county, who did a whole lot of damage]\n\nBut, of course, they found nothing. Lab tests would later reveal that the “saturated plant material” was actually loose-leaf tea, which Addie Harte drinks on a regular basis. Why did the field tests come up positive for pot? As I wrote back in February, it’s almost as if these tests come up positive whenever the police need them to. A partial list of substances that the tests have mistaken for illegal drugs would include sage, chocolate chip cookies, motor oil, spearmint, soap, tortilla dough, deodorant, billiard’s chalk, patchouli, flour, eucalyptus, breath mints, Jolly Ranchers and vitamins. Back in 2009, the Marijuana Policy Project demonstrated how easily the tests could be manipulated to generate positive results :\n\nAs a lab-coated and rubber glove wearing researcher from the South Carolina Center for Biotechnology dumped a sample of oregano into a field test kit, Mintwood Media’s Adam Eidinger produced a positive test result for cocaine with another kit simply by exposing it to the atmosphere. “This is just air,” Eidinger said, opening up a test and waving it as the reagent turned orange, indicating a positive result.\n\nThis 2009 video, sponsored by the Marijuana Policy Project, demonstrates how tests for illegal drugs could potentially be manipulated to generate false results. (Marijuana Policy Project and Mintwood Media Collective)\n\nThe testing done at the press conference replicated that done earlier by the researchers, who found that a surprisingly large number of common substances generated false positive results for the presence of drugs. “While testing the specificity of the KN Reagent test kits with 42 non-marijuana substances, I observed that 70% of these tests rendered a false positive,” said Dr. Omar Bagasra, director of the Center for Biotechnology, who conducted the experiments.\n\nThat research came as part of new report, False Positives Equal False Justice, by forensics expert John Kelly in collaboration with former FBI chief scientist and narcotics officer Dr. Frederick Whitehurst. In the report, the pair uncovered “a drug testing regime of fraudulent forensics used by police, prosecutors, and judges which abrogates every American’s constitutional rights,” as Kelly wrote in the executive summary.\n\n“Law enforcement officials, forensic drug analysts, and prosecutors knowingly employ the flawed Duquenois-Levine and KN Reagent tests as well as mere conclusory police reports to wrongfully prosecute and convict millions of individuals for anti-marijuana law violations,” Kelly wrote.\n\nThis is the same brand of test kit used in the Harte case. Despite the fact that the sheriff’s department didn’t begin investigating the Hartes until at least seven months after their allegedly suspicious activity (again — shopping at a gardening store) first attracted the notice of police, the sheriff’s department couldn’t wait for the more accurate laboratory tests to confirm that the “saturated plant material” was marijuana before sending a SWAT team into the Harte home. Doing so would have jeopardized the news hook of tying the raids to 4/20. It took all of 10 days to complete those lab tests. The lab not only concluded that substance wasn’t pot, the analysts added, “It does not look anything like marijuana leaves or stems.”\n\nAt the conclusion of the raids, the Sheriff’s Department held a press conference to tout their success. News reports emphasized that the raids had turned up drug activity “in good neighborhoods” in places like Leawood (where the Hartes live), and at the homes of “average Johnson County families.”\n\n[In the end, 2015 saw no “war on cops\" and no “national crime wave\"]\n\nOnce they had been cleared of any wrongdoing, the Hartes wanted to know what happened. Why had they been raided? What possible probable cause could the police have had for sending a SWAT team into their home first thing in the morning? But even that information would prove difficult to obtain. Under Kansas law, the sheriff’s department wasn’t obligated to turn over any information related to the raid — not to the Hartes, not to the media, not to anyone. The couple eventually had to hire an attorney to get a judge to order the sheriff to release the information. They spent more than $25,000 in legal fees just to learn why the sheriff had sent a SWAT team into their home. Once they finally had that information, the Hartes filed a lawsuit.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Court Judge John W. Lungstrum dismissed every one of the Hartes’s claims. Lungstrum found that sending a SWAT team into a home first thing in the morning based on no more than a positive field test and spotting a suspect at a gardening store was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. He found that the police had probable cause for the search, and that the way the search was conducted did not constitute excessive force. He found that the Hartes had not been defamed by the raid or by the publicity surrounding it. He also ruled that the police were under no obligation to know that drug testing field kits are inaccurate, nor were they obligated to wait for the more accurate lab tests before conducting the SWAT raid. The only way they’d have a claim would be if they could show that the police lied about the results, deliberately manipulated the tests or showed a reckless disregard for the truth — and he ruled that the Hartes had failed to do so.\n\nKeep in mind that this was a ruling for summary judgment. This was not a trial. To dismiss the suit at this stage, Lungstrum needed to view the facts in a light most favorable to the Hartes. And yet he still found that at no point did the police violate the family’s constitutional rights.\n\nThe Hartes’s fight wasn’t completely in vain. The couple also made a political push to change Kansas law when it comes to police records and transparency. In May, the legislature passed a modest reform bill. Here’s what I wrote about the bill at the time:\n\nBut while the bill is a step in the right direction, it’s far from a resounding victory for transparency, and it leaves Kansas well behind the rest of the country on this issue. Whereas the current law seals all search warrant affidavits by default, the bill would codify the presumption that the records will be made available to the owner of the premises that was searched.\n\nBut there are a couple catches. Prosecutors can file a motion within five days of the search to keep the records sealed. There’s a justifiable reason for that — some searches may be part of an ongoing investigation, the details of which could be revealed in the affidavit for the warrant. The problem, of course, is that a prosecutor could just as easily file for a seal to protect himself, his office or the police officers involved from embarrassment. The onus would then be on the wrongly searched to hire an attorney to fight the seal.\n\nThe far more problematic part of the law is that, while it removes the presumption that all documents related to a fruitless search should be sealed, it unseals them only for the owners of the premises that was searched. These records will still be kept sealed from the public. (It seems clear from the law that the owners could then make the documents public themselves.) That provision makes it extremely difficult for, say, a media outlet to do a broad survey of how searches are conducted by a particular police agency. (Like this, for example.)\n\nTo do such a survey or investigation, a journalist would need to get permission from all of the people whose homes or businesses were searched, turning up no evidence of criminality. Without access to the documents, though, there is no way to know who those people are — or if they even exist. It makes it impossible to know if there is a problem, and impossible to identify the extent of the problem if one exists. It would be up to the people wrongly searched to come forward on their own.\n\nI was in Kansas a few months ago and spoke to a number of people who were subjected to extraordinarily violent home raids and searches. They were terrified of going public. They talked to me only because I have written on these issues in the past and felt comfortable that I wouldn’t reveal their names.\n\nAn earlier, more robust reform bill initially passed the Kansas house 113-10 but was then gutted by the state’s Senate after heavy lobbying from prosecutors. During the debate over an earlier version of the bill, opponents made it clear that media scrutiny is precisely what they feared.\n\nThe bill drew a sharp reaction from law enforcement circles. Prosecutors contended the bill would provide gritty details about criminal cases that the media would sensationalize.\n\nRiley County Attorney Barry Wilkerson said the bill does more more to help the media than to help individuals.\n\n“It’s not going to be the public that’s going to rush to the courthouse to get an affidavit. It’s going to be the media” . . .\n\nAnd, of course, we can’t have the media looking into critical public safety initiatives like “Operation Constant Gardener.” If such scrutiny revealed that cops consider merely shopping at a garden supply store to be suspicious behavior, that drug testing field kits are more about circumventing the Fourth Amendment than accurate results or that a sheriff’s boast of having shut down a drug operation run by an “average family” in a “good neighborhood” was actually a terrifying raid in which SWAT cops held two kids at gunpoint because their mother enjoyed drinking tea … well, some people might begin to question the wisdom of the drug war.\n\n[The age of “pre-crime\" has arrived]\n\nThe Hartes are also a white, financially sound couple who both happened to have worked for the CIA. Most people on the receiving end of these raids aren’t white, aren’t middle-class, didn’t once work for a federal intelligence agency and don’t have $25,000 to fund a fight in court. If even those advantages can’t help the Hartes win some accountability, you can imagine the long odds faced by the typical victim of a botched raid.\n\nThe Hartes’s attorney recently told KMBC that they will likely appeal Lungstrum’s decision.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nIn April 2012, a Kansas SWAT team raided the home of Robert and Addie Harte, their 7-year-old daughter and their 13-year-old son.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00006-of-00064--699", "original_text": "The last time Eve Ensler and I met, she was sporting a sleek black bob and shiny boots, and had Jane Fonda on her arm. It was 10 years ago, when Hollywood actors were falling over themselves to perform her hit play, the Vagina Monologues, in front of audiences who got a thrill out of hearing stars say \"cunt\" on stage. Back then, post-feminism was still the height of fashion, Sex And The City was still on air, and I was growing tired of celebrity froth and rude words being passed off as radicalism. Ensler recalls finding me \"intense and scary, and hostile to everything we were doing\".\n\nSince that interview, a great deal has happened. The complacency of post-feminism has been replaced by a new, much more indignant movement of grassroots groups such as Vagenda and UK Feminista. Ensler has very nearly died from uterine cancer. She has also created a global women's campaign called One Billion Rising, which on Valentine's Day last year brought close to one billion women out on to the streets to protest against violence towards women, and will do so again next Friday. This time round, we find each other so unrecognisably altered that the interview dissolves into unexpected intimacy, and by the time we say goodbye, I am quite shaken.\n\nThe contrast is striking as soon as I arrive. Her Manhattan loft is done out in colourful drapes fashioned from Indian saris, and she bounces around it with an unselfconscious ease in her own skin that is arresting and compelling. Her pre-cancer bob has been replaced by a more haphazardly friendly crop, and the old angular severity and faint air of ambition have vanished. With less than three weeks to go, preparations for OBR are reaching fever pitch and Ensler is buzzing, because it looks as though its second year will be even bigger than its first.\n\nThe idea behind it is both simple and fantastically ambitious. According to UN figures, one in three women on the planet will be beaten or sexually assaulted. That works out at one billion women, so Ensler wants a billion to gather on 14 February outside buildings that represent justice – police stations, courthouses, government offices – and dance. That's it. Where and how they dance is up to them; each gathering is organised at a local level. In Miami, they plan to stop the traffic, to highlight sex trafficking; in Peru, they're getting construction workers to carry placards renouncing street harassment. The sole unifying principle is that they dance to end violence against women. Last year, women and men danced in more than 200 countries.\n\nEnsler always says that when she first began organising Valentine's Day events back in 1998, she assumed violence against women would by now be a thing of the past. Her V-Day movement was obviously going to stop men beating women, and eradicate rape and sexual assault from the planet. She never dreamed, she likes to say, that 15 years later she would have to come up with an even bolder solution, but I'd always taken this for rhetorical playfulness. She didn't seriously believe she could end all sexual violence against women, did she?\n\n\"Well, that's a good question.\" Ensler grins. \"Here's what I think. Look at slavery. It's utterly barbaric. How could a practice like that absolutely exist, ever? So, raping women? Same thing. How could that exist? So part of me goes, of course it has to end now! We have to have an idea that it's possible to end this. Because if we all keep going around as if, well, it's just part of what life is, it's part of the human condition, it's who men are, it becomes permanently normalised, right? So, yes, I do hold an idea that it's possible. Absolutely. I wouldn't keep doing this work if I didn't. I'd be an insane person. Now, obviously it hasn't happened yet. But at the same time, the world has changed. We are talking about violence against women, it is on the front page of newspapers. It wasn't 16 years ago. So it has changed, and that makes me think, why can't we end it? I'm going to believe it's possible until I leave this world, because that gets me up in the morning. And if that's a pipe dream, so be it.\"\n\nEnsler was always an idealist, but never planned on becoming a global activist. When she wrote the Vagina Monologues in 1996, she was a minor playwright just hoping to see it staged in a tiny downtown New York theatre. It has since been produced in 140 countries, in multiple languages, and Ensler discovered that audiences all over the world were laughing and crying in exactly the same places.\n\n\"So then I began to understand that this worldwide violation of women, this denial of desire or pleasure, this blaming of women for their sexuality when they are abused, is actually universal. When you're fighting female genital mutilation in Gambia, or you're fighting gang rape in Congo, or you're fighting acid burning in Pakistan, you are in your world believing this is happening in your culture, because it's specific to your local reality. But when you suddenly understand that violence against women is the methodology that sustains patriarchy, then you suddenly get that we're in this together. Women across the world are in this together.\"\n\nEducated western women struggle to see parallels between their reality and an Afghan villager's, say, so the concept of global patriarchy is a tough sell, isn't it? \"The so-called liberated women?\" she blinks. \"I'm not buying all of that. If we look at this country, 300,000 girls on college campuses in America are sexually assaulted every year. Is that an end to oppression? One out of three in the US military is raped by their comrades? So we're not talking about an end to that violence, absolutely not.\"\n\nUp to this point, I'm with Ensler. But I've always taken for granted that rational argument is the way to get change, whereas she says, \"We should be hysterical. Yes, I really think so. I mean, look at what's going on! Sometimes I think we've all learned how to be so well-behaved and polite, and there are many clever people, and we have access to so much information – but the world is still falling at its knees. We have 85 people who make the same amount as 3.5 billion. We have one in three women on the planet being raped or beaten. And all our best thinking – thinking – has brought us here. All this great information is just spinning more information. Where is the action part, which is about rising up to do something about it? Until that thinking is translated into the body, and we are feeling what is happening, nothing is going to get us to motivate to change. I mean,\" she begins to laugh in amazement, \"I love that people think theorising is stronger than dancing. I love that they think that's a stronger way of changing the world.\"\n\nIsn't it? I ask her to explain why I am wrong. \"Where do I begin? Last year, close to one billion people danced, and here are the things that happened. In the buildup to the dancing, coalitions came together that have never come together before. They understood their body, they understood their sexuality, they understood love. They were able to see themselves working together in ways they couldn't do before.\"\n\nEnsler is in good company, for if the new feminist movements have one thing in common, it's an aversion to prescriptive ideological programmes. All this inclusivity has been good at bringing a new generation of women to feminism, but I wonder how far it can be sustainable once they get down to the business of working out what actually to do. Ensler knows that nothing will change until women are economically equal, which is both true and a tall order, but is she saying men are basically violent towards women because they have the economic power to get away with it – or do only damaged men damage women?\n\nShe sighs. \"I've been thinking about violence against women for 16 years, and I wish I could tell you I was closer to an understanding of what motivates men to do it. But I have a few theories. One is that we bring up boys to be disconnected from their hearts at a very young age. What are the defining qualities for a man? That you don't cry.\n\n\"Let's just stay with that. If I had not been allowed to cry in my life, I would be either dead or in a mental institution. What is the one thing you can do when all else fails? You can cry. You can get rid of the trauma. What if you don't have that? Where does it go? It goes into self-hatred, it goes into rage, it goes into shame – and somebody's going to pay the price for that. When men get angry and frustrated, they beat up their wives. And once you are far enough dissociated from yourself, anything's possible. Imagine a man on top of a woman who's screaming no no no, and he's continuing. Where is he, that he doesn't feel what she's saying? He's gone.\"\n\nEnsler talks very quickly, often with a cadence not unlike a charismatic preacher's, in sentences that build and rally and roll in a great rhythmic refrain. But when I ask why she thinks her own father raped and beat her senseless throughout her childhood, her face freezes, and the words come slowly and haltingly.\n\n\"I think, umm... I think my father wanted control. Control was a very big thing for my father's generation. They were taught to be in control of their feelings, their family – in control.\" She pauses. \"And I think when anything felt out of his control – his emotions, maybe his feelings towards me, an autonomous being doing things he didn't tell me to do – it was absolutely unbearable.\" After another pause, she adds quietly, \"There is an insane sadism that comes from believing you have a right to control other people. And when people don't let you do that, it just gets deeper and more psychotic.\n\n\"The other piece was that my father didn't know what to do with his sexual feelings. I think there are many parents who have sexual feelings towards their children, and we don't have any discourse around that. What do you do with those feelings? People punish the child for evoking those feelings.\"\n\nEnsler was born in a middle-class suburb of New York 60 years ago, to a rather glacial housewife and a domineering corporate executive who began abusing her when she was a few years old. Her mother never intervened, and her younger sister witnessed the violence helplessly. As soon as she was old enough to leave home, Ensler took a lot of class-A drugs, had a lot of promiscuous sex, became an alcoholic, lived in communes and numbed her way through her 20s until she met her husband. She cleaned up, worked with homeless women, campaigned against nuclear weapons, got divorced in her mid-30s and became a small-time playwright on the beatnik downtown New York scene, until, at 43, she wrote the Vagina Monologues and the sexual violence of her childhood became the motor of her existence.\n\nFay Weldon once said, \"Rape is not the worst thing that can ever happen to a woman, if you are safe, alive and unmarked afterwards.\" Germaine Greer has argued something similar, claiming, \"It is not women who have decided that rape is so heinous, but men.\" Is it just possible, I ask Ensler, that we have accorded rape greater emotional power than it merits?\n\n\"That is just the most ludicrous thing I've ever heard.\" She looks stricken, and speaks slowly and deliberately. \"I know what rape does. What people don't understand about rape – and it's so hard to communicate – is it's not an act, it's a life. It robs you of dignity, agency, choice. It is an invasion that renders you incapable of trust, and makes intimacy one of the most terrifying things. A woman in Haiti said something brilliant to me – she said it makes sex something you're obsessed with but can never enjoy. The sexual assault and the beatings by my father made me leave my body, and you know, I am 60 years old and it is only this year that I'm finally able to actually purge his negative and dark projections into me, and reinhabit my own body.\"\n\nHad I asked if she thought she inhabited her own body when we met a decade ago, she would have said yes without any hesitation. She'd done years of therapy and had just written a play, The Good Body, all about women's relationships with their bodies. But when Ensler began passing blood five years ago, and her stomach distended, and she suffered terrible indigestion, and felt nauseous, she decided not to pay attention. By the time she finally saw a doctor, cancer had spread. It was stage III, nudging stage IV, and the odds of her surviving were bleak. How could she of all people have ignored what her body was telling her?\n\n\"I know, I know.\" She smiles. \"Cancer was just like a smash into the wall – like, 'Girl, you are so not in your body, you are so not paying attention to yourself.' But I had things to do! When my doctor called to tell me I had cancer, he said, 'I have two things to say, and you have to listen to me. You cannot go to Haiti tomorrow. And you have cancer.' He had to say them in that order because he was sure I would keep going, because my body was secondary to everything. I didn't value it.\"\n\nEnsler believes she got cancer because her body became literally sick of the compulsion to keep proving herself. \"I had to prove I wasn't stupid, I had to prove that I was somebody, I had to prove that I could do it all on my own. And I think I had gone as far as I could go. I thought, what is the point of this – am I going to do this for ever? Am I going to prove myself to death?\"\n\nI'd been expecting a fairly straightforward conversation about Ensler's work with OBR, but as she talks about cancer, I feel myself turn cold with fear, because the self she is describing sounds horribly recognisable. If that's why she got ill, then I'm in trouble. Ensler is not the first person to talk about cancer in these terms, but the peculiar persuasiveness of her intimacy makes me blurt out: \"The truth is, I've got no idea what 'being in the body' even means. I've only ever lived in my head.\"\n\nIt's true; for as long as I can remember, my body just seemed like a troublesome inconvenience, the least important thing I could think of. \"I could have told you that about you,\" Ensler says. \"And it's so important to get in your body. Can I tell you, it's different in here [motioning to her heart]. And it's really good.\"\n\nBut I don't think I ever really feel much about anything, I admit. I just think and do.\n\nI'm amazed to hear myself telling her this, but she looks unsurprised. \"Oh God, I so relate. I had a tumour the size of a mango and I didn't even notice. And you know what, where are we going with all that fancy head stuff? We're achieving and doing, but where the fuck are we going? When I sat there and they said to me, the cancer might be in your liver, it was like a new world. Wake the fuck up, sister. And I bless it. Because I don't know what else would have taken me there. Can I tell you, I am now the happiest I have been in my life. Profoundly. I'm working from a different engine now; I don't have to work, I want to. And that was the beginning of this life, which is so good.\"\n\nIs she saying she is glad she got cancer? \"Are you kidding? Of course I am. I wasn't in the beginning. But then I really got it. Because I realised I was disconnected from everything and everybody. And there is such a loneliness with it. Once you live in your body, you can just be.\"\n\nShe studies me again. \"How much are you living to prove yourself?\"\n\nDon't we all have to prove ourselves? Nothing comes unconditionally.\n\n\"Bullshit. It's all bullshit. I'm convinced that the core of everything that is wrong on this planet is people feeling that they are not good enough. But there is nothing to prove. You don't have to do anything. You know, I don't really give a fuck if you're a good interviewer. I actually like you – not your do, but you.\"\n\nBut we are what we do, aren't we? \"No. No. No!\" Deep down I think I've always known this must be true, but Ensler is the first person who has ever made it sound believable. She grips my hand. \"Let me tell you something, if you keep going on this path you will get sick, it's inevitable.\"\n\nThis doesn't really feel like an interview any more. The last time we met, if someone had told me that our next encounter would end with me asking her how I go about getting back into my own body, I would have said they were mad. But she can get A-listers to perform a play about vaginas, persuade a billion people to dance, and believes she can end rape, so I don't know why I'm surprised. She is one of the most powerfully magnetising personalities I've ever met.\n\nWe stand and she hugs me. \"You don't have to get cancer to come back into your own body, you really don't. I got to do it so you don't have to. You think your body is just an engine, a machine to move you along. Let me tell you, I love my body so much now, I adore this body. I'm missing seven organs and 70 nodes, and I'm functioning. How could I not love this body?\"", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nThe last time Eve Ensler and I met, she was sporting a sleek black bob and shiny boots, and had Jane Fonda on her arm.

Courtesy Mongrel Media.\n\nOver the last 44 years, director James Ivory and his recently deceased life partner, producer Ismail Merchant, built one of the most recognizable brands in modern cinema. Their newest and final collaboration, The White Countess, concerns a blind American (Ralph Fiennes) and a Russian aristocrat (Natasha Richardson, never better, never more radiant) who open a nightclub amid the turbulence of 1930s Shanghai. Merchant Ivoryâs valedictory effort shows off their usual strengths: the film is pretty to look at and employs top British actors in all the key roles. The White Countess is as good a picture as the couple has produced in years; nonetheless, it marks the end of a franchise that was better at atmosphere than it was at storytelling, better at producing a marketable type of beauty than competent films.\n\nMerchant was born in Bombay, Ivory hailed from Berkeley, Calif.; both shared an acute case of anglophilia, distilling a nostalgic vision of Englishness. Merchant and Ivory began making art-house films in the U.K. in the early 1960s and broke through in North America in 1985, with A Room with a View; based on the novel by E.M. Forster, it told the story of a young English gentlewoman (Helena Bonham Carter) whose passions are unleashed by a trip to Italy.\n\nMerchant Ivoryâs depiction of England was one of sun-soaked barley fields and ancient oak trees, bespectacled literary fops wearing bespoke suits (Daniel Day-Lewis in Room) and intrepid spinster travellers in free-flowing skirts and high-collared blouses (Judi Dench in Room). This hoary vision annoyed many Britons, while enchanting North Americans. Merchant Ivory hired many young, talented English actors, many of whom have gone on to busy international careers (most notably Day-Lewis, Bonham Carter, Hugh Grant and Rupert Graves).\n\nMerchant and Ivory chose to depict pre-First World War Britain so glowingly because they loathed what the country has become. âEngland has been inherited by the lower classes who talk about making money and football,â Merchant once told Londonâs Sunday Telegraph. âAn Englishman's word is no longer his bond.â\n\nWhere the grass is always greener: From left, George Emerson (Julian Sands), Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Lucy Honeychurch (Helen Bonham Carter) in Room with a View. Courtesy Warner Home Video.\n\nIn the final analysis, Merchant and Ivory are the Crabtree & Evelyn of filmmaking. Liking Merchant Ivory films has become akin to enjoying tennis or classical music. Never mind that you havenât seen a Merchant Ivory film — or watched an entire tennis match or sat through a symphony — in years; you identified yourself long ago as the sort of person who likes Merchant Ivory movies, and youâre sticking to it.\n\nDespite having produced only a handful of decent films (and many barking dogs), the duo succeeded in making their double-barrelled name a latter-day shibboleth. Fans are part of an international tribe of like-minded individuals: well-educated, sensitive and, more than anything else, upper crust (or, at least, aspiring to be upper crust). âDo you like Merchant Ivory?â has become a question much like Aimez-vous Brahms? — a reference to a FranÃ§oise Sagan novel that wonât be wasted on Merchant Ivory lovers.\n\nTheir films usually have plots that float about aimlessly and dialogue that rings false and pretentious. (Much of the blame for this rests with Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, who wrote the scripts for 23 of the films.) Although the movies are informed by an effortless cultural sophistication, they lack a parallel political sophistication and get downright clumsy whenever they try to approach public issues. Merchant Ivory productions attempt to escape from the hurly-burly; they are about waking up from the nightmare of history, rather than engaging with it.\n\nCase in point: the execrable (and typical) Jefferson in Paris (1995). Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) comes to Paris as the American ambassador and promptly falls for an artsy Englishwoman (Greta Scacchi). As the affair gains steam, so does the revolutionary movement. The filmmakers drop in a few hilariously decorous riots here and there, between aristocratic soirÃ©es, but they are made to seem beside the point. (Commoners don't get much screen time in Merchant Ivory flicks.) Meanwhile, Nolte and Scacchi, a pair of accomplished acting pros, gamely wade through spectacularly wooden dialogue:\n\nHe: âYou appear all clarity and light, of this world, not the next.â She: âIt is true I was born in the sun and I can't live without it.â\n\nEnter Thandie Newton, as Jeffersonâs slave, Sally Hemmings, who has to play at once a budding heroine of the freedom movement and an insipid, yessuh-Massah housegirl. As the film goes on, Sally gradually supplants the Englishwoman in her masterâs affections. Revolving wildly around this love triangle are Jefferson's intolerant daughter (Gwyneth Paltrow, more lumpen than usual), who may convert to Catholicism; Marie-Antoinette, playing at being a dairy maid; a hypnotist who puts hysterical courtiers under; and Monsieur Guillotin, who demonstrates a model of his decapitation device at a dinner party.\n\nBig wigs: Richard Cosway (Simon Callow) and Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi) in Jefferson in Paris. Courtesy Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.\n\nIn short, the film is a mess. The characters are incoherent. One moment, Jefferson is a sneaky sex-hound, the next a high-minded idealist; he never feels at all human. The projectâs politics are muddled: Jeffersonâs views on slavery are even more confused than the historical record reveals. Plus, the filmmakers donât even let Greta Scacchi have a ripped-bodice sex scene, which is like giving Pavarotti a non-singing part.\n\nMerchant and Ivory did, however, bring certain second-tier strengths to all their work: an impressionist's visual sensibility, a fashion historianâs love of period finery and a real appreciation of literary classics written in the understated Edwardian vein. Their best films â The Forster trio of A Room With a View, Maurice (1987) and Howards End (1992), as well as the neo-Edwardian The Remains of the Day (1993) — provoke a sort of restful ease, the aah of coming into an art gallery, which is rare enough to be welcome. Right from the credit sequences in these films, we feel that we are in a civilized space; not even Greta Scacchi would dare disrobe here.\n\nThese films all dramatize the struggle to overcome repression, to come out (as whatever you are). In the 1980s and early 1990s, these period pieces spoke to a society at the tail end of the battle against repression. In their subtle way, the films contributed to this last great push for freer self-expression, which largely accounts for their popularity among suburban bohemians. Twenty years later, with everyone out (as whatever they are), the message seems quaint and irrelevant. Weâve jettisoned our repressed upbringings; now what? The films end where our real lives now begin.\n\nPerhaps Merchant Ivoryâs greatest contribution has been recognizing and championing literary talent. But if their book picks are generally first rate, theyâve often failed to translate good novels into quality films. The Forster books, as well as Kazuo Ishiguroâs The Remains of the Day, were easy adaptations: both writers pen naturalistic, evocative dialogue and situate their characters in picturesque locales. The franchise invariably made a hash of harder-to-transmute works, utterly squelching the bright airiness of Diane Johnsonâs comedy of manners, Le Divorce (2003), and getting lost in Henry Jamesâs labyrinthine prose in The Bostonians (1984) and The Golden Bowl (2000).\n\nThankfully, the script for The White Countess comes from Ishiguro, one of the most disciplined writers at work today. (He based the story very loosely on Junichiro Tanizakiâs novel The Diary of a Mad Old Man, as well as his own grandfatherâs stories of 1930s Shanghai.) The American diplomat played by Fiennes loses his family and his eyesight in a terrorist attack. Understandably embittered, he leaves affairs of state behind to open the nightclub the White Countess, which, like a Merchant Ivory film, offers a getaway from the rough-and-tumble world outside.\n\nAt one point in the film, the well-dressed, distinguished American sits on a barstool, sighing reflectively. âOut there,â he says, âthere is chaos, mistrust, deceit.â This is an economical description of the raw materials of real drama. Sadly, Merchant Ivoryâs films never could deal with such messy stuff. In the movie, the nightclub has a good run, but must close when the Japanese invade the city. The White Countess is certainly a stylish place to hang out, but, in a real crisis, it shuts down.

Retirees now living in Honolulu, the Gregorys have basically their entire life savings — about $2.5 million — invested in just one stock: Apple Inc.\n\nThe Gregorys’ love affair with Apple AAPL flouts every bit of investment advice doled out by magazines like this one and by mainstream investment strategists. No investor — especially a retiree whose portfolio should be geared toward income and wealth preservation, not growth and risk taking — should have all his money invested in just one stock. Right?\n\nWell, before you dismiss the Gregorys as fools, ask yourself these questions. Do you live in a $650,000 luxury condo a stone’s throw from Waikiki Beach? And did you have the smarts, conviction, and stick-to-itiveness to turn a $200,000 investment in 2004 — in a seemingly past-its-prime computer stock with a mere 3% market share — into a nearly $3 million windfall that financed a dream early retirement? “All the advice was to diversify, but in our experience, diversification didn’t really work,” says Jeanne Gregory, 62, who, like her husband, Terry, 58, is retired from the advertising industry. “Diversification,” adds Terry, “may be good for preserving your wealth, but we needed our wealth to grow.”\n\nMORE: 15 top stock picks from star investors\n\nThe Gregorys are not alone. Online message boards like the MacObserver.com boards, Proboards’ Apple Finance Board, and the investor forums on the Braeburn Group website are filled with Apple obsessives who proudly admit to having all or most of their money in Apple.\n\nFor many of these folks, investing in the stock — and keeping tabs on the company (often for hours a day) — isn’t just a financial pursuit. It’s a higher calling. “Apple is not just a maker of widgets or digital devices,” says all-Apple investor Robert Paul Leitao, director of operations for a Catholic church in Burbank, Calif., and also the founder of the Braeburn Group of independent Apple analysts (a website Leitao named after an apple variety with “smart and complex flavor”). “I believe the design and functionality of Apple products speak to the dignity of the human experience.”\n\nTen years ago there wasn’t a single mutual fund that counted Apple as its largest holding, according to Morningstar. Today there are 683 — or one out of every eight funds. Some of the funds are just about as all-in on Apple as the IRS rules for mutual fund diversification allow. There are 12 funds with 20% or more of their assets in Apple. There’s now an Apple-only hedge fund — Bullish Cross Asset Management, which trades both AAPL shares and options — run by Andy Zaky, an independent Apple analyst and a Fortune.com contributor.\n\nWhy such fervor? “It’s an emotional stock,” explains Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. “People get excited about the new product. The news flow about how well the new products are selling intensifies that excitement, which affects the buying behavior.” Professional money managers get caught up just as easily as individual investors do. “They have iPhones and iPads,” says Sacconaghi. “They go to the stores and see the massive lines. You can’t really do that with, say, enterprise software.”\n\nFor those with the fortitude to put all their apples in this basket, the stock has been a fabulous wealth creator. At one point this year, Apple was responsible for 17% of the gains of the entire Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX), according to Sacconaghi. Over the past 10 years, the stock has soared some 7,800%, vs. 54% for the S&P 500. A $50,000 investment in Apple in December 2002 would be worth $3.9 million today.\n\nMORE: Where does Apple stock go from here?\n\nApple’s shorter-term gains have been almost as impressive because they’ve come at a time when the overall market has declined. Whereas a $50,000 investment in the S&P 500 in December 2007 has shrunk to $46,000 (excluding dividends), the same investment in Apple would be worth $144,000 today.\n\nOf course, that last number would have been even bigger — closer to $180,000 — a few months ago, before Apple’s nosedive from $702 to $560 a share. The recent selloff is definitely a turning point for the stock. The question is, Turning to where? Skeptics see it as the beginning of the end of Apple’s amazing run: “The pie is almost baked,” declares Nomura analyst Stuart Jeffrey. For the true believers, however, it’s an early Christmas present — the ultimate door-buster for Wall Street bargain hunters. Apple’s price/earnings ratio of 13 is near a 10-year low, and Apple now has a lower valuation than large-cap peers with far inferior earnings growth such as Wal-Mart (14 P/E) WMT , Coca-Cola (20) KO , Pfizer (19) PFE , and Qualcomm (18) QCOM .\n\nThe stock is so cheap that Mark Mulholland, portfolio manager of the Matthew 25 fund MXXVX , has been adding to his Apple position even though he already had an 18% position in the stock before the decline. “It’s unbelievable,” Mulholland said when the stock dipped below $550. “I am so psyched to be able to get shares of Apple at this level.”\n\nTerry and Jeanne Gregory are sticking with Apple too. They and other Apple-centric investors we interviewed say the media have made too much of Apple’s recent missteps, which include the iPhone 5 map snafu, an earnings miss in October, and the ousters of iOS software chief Scott Forstall and Apple Store head John Browett.\n\n“Apple doing good is not news. Only Apple doing bad is news,” says Terry, adding that he actually prefers the new Apple Maps app to Google Maps.\n\nIf the Gregorys seem skeptical of the financial press, perhaps that’s because bucking the establishment is how they got rich on Apple in the first place. In 2004 they inherited about $200,000 after the death of Jeanne’s parents. At the time, both Terry and Jeanne worked in a niche of the advertising industry — typesetting and print production — that was threatened with obsolescence in the world of digital printing and online advertising. They knew they didn’t have much job security, and the returns they had been earning on mutual funds in their 401(k)s were underwhelming. “My feeling was that we would be better off putting it all in one stock that we thought would perform well rather than spreading it out,” says Jeanne. “We weren’t exactly kids at the time, and it was clear that we weren’t going to have this much money to invest again. We had to make it count.”\n\nBoth Terry and Jeanne had used Apple computers at ad agencies. “Apple changed our whole industry,” Terry says, noting how every year the computers seemed to get smaller and more innovative. The Gregorys were already Apple fans when the iPod Mini came out in 2004, convincing Terry in particular that Apple’s emphasis on miniaturization would be a strategic advantage.\n\nJeanne printed up some information on the newest iteration of the iPod and then paid a visit to their local brokerage office, hoping to get some expert advice on whether Apple was the right investment for them. No such luck. Her broker just wanted to talk about new funds and account services the brokerage was selling.\n\nMORE: Why the stock market is so often wrong about Apple\n\nThey wound up buying Apple stock at $30 a share, and have stuck with it ever since, selling shares only to pay for their Honolulu condo and for vacations. They spend an hour or two every morning reading and discussing the latest Apple headlines, but nothing they’ve read to date has shaken their faith. “You know that scene in You’ve Got Mail when Maureen Stapleton confides to Meg Ryan, ‘I’m very rich — I bought Intel INTC at $6’?” Jeanne says. “Well, sometimes I feel like that’s us.”\n\nApple made Robert Paul Leitao a millionaire — almost all of his $1.5 million investment portfolio is in Apple. But Leitao seems to get almost as much satisfaction from the Apple-related windfalls of his Braeburn Group readers as he does from his own gains. “I get e-mails that are truly heartwarming,” he says, “people who just wanted to thank me for giving them the conviction to stick with it so that now they have the money to pay for their child’s college education.”\n\nHis emotional connection to the Apple story makes sense given how he came to invest in the stock. When Leitao’s father passed away 26 years ago — 25 years to the day before Steve Jobs’ death — he inherited his dad’s old MacPlus and wound up using it to write his father’s eulogy. Leitao considers that eulogy “the most stirring and most challenging” thing he’s ever written, and he credits the Macintosh itself for inspiring him.\n\nA single parent at the time, Leitao began squirreling away money to buy shares of a company that, to many outsiders, including his own stockbroker, seemed to be circling the drain. “Right before Apple bought Next and announced that Steve Jobs was coming back, I got a call from my broker,” Leitao says. “He was trying to sell me on some other stocks, and I told him I wanted to stick with Apple. He got indignant and told me I needed to face the music and accept that the Apple story was over.”\n\nLike the Gregorys, Leitao and his family have a multitude of Apple products in their home — iPod, iPhone, iPad, and “more Macs than people.” For him, it’s all interrelated. “I investigate all the products the same way I investigate the financials. I’m constantly checking and rechecking the logic behind my investment decision.”\n\nBut his thesis for owning the stock hinges in large part on something that is basically uncheckable. “We’re all pretty much betting on Apple’s ability to continue to innovate,” Leitao says. He thinks sales growth for the iPhone could peak in a year or so, which means Apple will have to, in Leitao’s words, “disrupt a new market in order to maintain current levels of revenue and earnings growth.” Now that Apple has nearly half a billion iTunes subscribers, he’s guessing that the new market will be video content. But that would involve challenging the cable companies’ stranglehold on mainstream television. “I don’t claim to be clairvoyant,” he says. “I simply have faith in Apple’s ability to innovate.”\n\nMORE: Disney CEO buys $1 million of Apple stock\n\nIt’s a semi-blind faith shared by institutional investors who own the stock too. “They’ve updated so many products this year, the question is, What do they have planned for 2013?” says Malcolm Fobes, portfolio manager of the Berkshire Focus fund BFOCX , which has a 23% position in Apple. (Fobes calls Apple, which he’s owned since 2004, a “holy grail” stock that offers both low valuation and high earnings growth.) “There’s a lot of talk about TV, but I think that’s a misdirection play. I think it’s going to be something we’ve never seen before.”\n\nOddly, the Apple-centric investor with the deepest doubts about the company’s ability to come up with the next big thing is the one with the most aggressive price target for the stock. Andy Zaky, the 33-year-old independent analyst and money manager at Bullish Cross, expects Apple to hit $2,000 a share within five years. At that price, Apple would have a market cap of nearly $2 trillion.\n\nFor Zaky, a lawyer by training, the Apple story is essentially an iPhone story. Globally, smartphones account for about 30% of handset sales, double the market share of a year ago. Given the rapid growth of the smartphone market — the penetration rate is already past 50% in the U.S. — he expects annual iPhone sales to increase from 65 million units a quarter to 200 million units within five years. The resulting earnings growth, he predicts, will drive the stock to $2,000 a share.\n\n“That’s going to be when Apple peaks,” Zaky says. “What it comes down to is that there’s no other market Apple could operate in that could produce close to the same level of revenue as smartphones. The TV market, for instance, is a fraction of smartphones in terms of total revenue.”\n\nMORE: New iMac is Apple’s best ever\n\nZaky thinks it’s “obvious” Apple will hit $2,000 a share and then plateau, with the company continuing to enjoy recurring (though not substantially growing) earnings from the sale of new iPhones and iPads. Presumably, Apple $2,000 would be almost as good for Zaky’s business as his own Apple-only portfolio. Apart from his asset-management business, Zaky has 750 subscribers to his online Apple newsletter, which costs $2,400 a year.\n\nBut nothing is really obvious when it comes to the future of technology. Sacconaghi, who has an $800 12-month price target for Apple, does believe that Apple’s iCloud, iTunes, and App Store customer base reduces the risk that existing users will migrate to a competing technology: “It means more buyers will be repeat purchasers, which makes it more difficult for sales to suddenly fall.”\n\nClearly the biggest threat to Apple now is the Google GOOG Android smartphone platform. For their part, the Gregorys insist they’re not worried. “Apple is like the haute couture lines in fashion pushing the edge of design,” says Jeanne. “Android is a knockoff.”\n\nShe’s right, of course. Then again, Microsoft MSFT Windows was a knockoff too.\n\nThis story is from the December 24, 2012 issue of Fortune.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nFORTUNE — Just thinking about Terry and Jeanne Gregory’s portfolio can be a little scary.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00008-of-00064--1108", "original_text": "Next up is Erin Murphy, a lawyer representing the U.S. House of Representatives, which appears as a friend of the court supporting Texas’s position.\n\nJustice Kennedy, whose earlier remarks appeared skeptical of the Obama administration’s position, now raises a troubling question for the challengers. Shouldn’t Texas have challenged the administration’s policy through the Administrative Procedure Act? Again, this is a procedural matter with real world impact, because it would delay the states’ ability to get into court while pursuing administrative remedies, probably allowing the DAPA program to take effect in the meantime. Ms. Murphy says the state could have taken that course, but wasn’t required to.\n\nMr. Keller responds that in contrast to the 1923 cases, it was Texas itself that suffered an injury to its “sovereign interests” by the DAPA program and its drivers license implications.\n\nJustice Breyer responds that under that theory, states could challenge any number of federal laws or programs on the grounds that their collateral effects imposed some costs on state government.\n\nThe two cases from 1923 he raises, however, are not obscure artifacts, but a part of any law student’s education: Frothingham v. Mellon and Massachusetts v. Mellon, the Mellon of the caption being President Harding’s treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon.\n\nThe cases rejected the concepts of “taxpayer standing” and the argument that states could represent the personal interest of their residents against the enforcement of federal law. The 1923 suits challenged the federal Maternity Act, which created a program to fight infant mortality, on the grounds that it exceeded federal powers and intruded on state authority.\n\nLike the DAPA lawsuit, they challenged a benefit the federal government sought to give to others. But the Supreme Court threw the suits out, saying the real issue was a political or policy dispute, not a legal one, and that permitting them to proceed would transfer power from elected officials to the judiciary. You give a benefit here, it hurts the taxpayers there, and that’s not the kind of injury that belongs in court, Justice Breyer says.\n\nJustice Breyer revives the standing argument, suggesting that hoary high court precedents foreclose Texas’s lawsuit.\n\n“Old Supreme Court cases never die,” he says. Unless they are overruled, they remain binding, sometimes like icebergs beneath the sea waiting to wreck a suit that unwittingly sails into it.\n\nWhile several of the parties represented made statements and took questions outside the court after arguments, at least one, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, did not. He headed back to his desk, having decided not to engage, a spokesman said.\n\nJustice Sotomayor then gets into the nitty gritty of the motor vehicle bureaucracy: How do you get a driver’s license in Texas? she asks. You go to the DMV, Mr. Keller says. Justice Sotomayor indicates she’s had similar experiences getting a license in New York and the District of Columbia.\n\nLines are very long, sometimes you wait all day, and the office closes up before getting to you, and you have to come back the next day. When you get to the window, the clerk gives you a temporary paper license–she’s had to wait weeks to get her permanent license in the mail. Since the DMV doesn’t seem to focus on customer service, why can’t Texas just make people wait longer to get a license? She questions whether issuing licenses to DAPA eligible aliens will really cost as much as the state maintains. Mr. Keller says the state incurs fixed costs per license regardless of the length of the lines at the DMV, because it must take various steps to authenticate the document so it meets federal identification standards.\n\nMeanwhile, outside the court (in real time), here are some Twitter reports from colleague Louise Radnofsky.\n\nJustice Kagan says then that perhaps Texas filed the wrong challenge — it should be attacking the older regulations that provide work permits, rather than DAPA which doesn’t directly do so.\n\nAlthough procedural, this is a significant point, because if the court adopts this reasoning, the state’s current lawsuit would fail.\n\nPressed by Justice Kagan, Mr. Keller concedes that DHS could categorically classify the aliens covered by DAPA as unlikely to be deported.\n\nThe government could even give them all identification cards indicating that they are “Low Priority” for deportation, he says. So your real gripe is the work authorization, Justice Kagan says. Mr. Keller says Texas objects to the “lawful status” DAPA purports to provide, because of other immigration regulations it triggers that allow for work authorization.\n\nThat’s it from Brent Kendall. Taking the baton is Jess Bravin.\n\nThe liberal justices jump right to the merits of Texas’s arguments and don’t spend a ton of time at the outset questioning the state’s standing to bring a lawsuit at all.\n\nThey do revisit the standing issue later. Again, Justice Sotomayor jumps in with comments on that issue. If Texas and the other states are allowed to sue to challenge the Obama administration on immigration, then it will be easier for states to attack all sorts of federal agency regulations that they don’t like, she says.\n\nMr. Keller says Congress has to grant legal authority first before the president can defer deportations in this manner.\n\nJustice Sotomayor says these immigrants are living “in the shadows” and repeats her earlier comment that many of these people are going to be in the U.S. whether people want them here or not.\n\nThe two go back and forth about the nitty gritty of past congressional and presidential actions on immigration and whether those actions provide support for what the president did here.\n\nNext to the podium is Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller to argue the states’ challenge to the Obama administration. Mr. Kelly says the administration’s actions are unprecedented, unlawful and the biggest change in immigration policy ever. Justice Sotomayor jumps in with a barrage of questions. The two spar for several minutes.\n\nIn real time, the argument has just ended. We’ll continue to update you on how the arguments went.\n\nCameras are poised for attorneys to come out but we have you covered now https://t.co/iR8OgjflqS pic.twitter.com/5LRWoYzOru\n\n— Louise Radnofsky (@louiseradnofsky) April 18, 2016\n\nJusice Alito says that if Mr. Saenz is correct on that point, these immigrants have established legal rights, not just a low priority status for deportation. He clearly thinks this is a problem.\n\nBefore Mr. Saenz sits down, Justice Alito has a hypothetical question. If an employer chooses not to hire an illegal immigrant who receives a DAPA deferral, could that employer be sued for discrimination? Yes, Mr. Saenz responds.\n\nChief Justice Roberts responds that the state will in fact lose money if it has to issue licenses. Isn’t that a classic basis for a lawsuit? he asks.\n\nAfter that initial statement, Mr. Saenz gets almost no time to argue the merits of his position in support of DAPA. Instead, he faces a flurry of procedural questions on whether the challengers have a right to sue. Mr. Saenz suggests Texas’s real concern isn’t the money it will have to spend on drivers licenses for immigrants. The state, he says, just doesn’t like what the Obama administration is doing politically. He says that motivation isn’t a valid basis for a lawsuit.\n\nThe second lawyer up, Mr. Saenz, argued on behalf of three unnamed, undocumented mothers of children who are U.S. citizens. Mr. Saenz said the women “live in daily fear they will be separated from their families.”\n\nMr. Verrilli said the president later received legal advice indicating that the newer, broader deferred action program was consistent with his legal authority.\n\nAt the end of Mr. Verrilli’s argument time, the chief justice quotes a statement the president made earlier in his presidency after he announced deferred deportation for child immigrants. President Obama at that time said any broader deferral for a larger group of immigrants “would be very difficult to defend legally.”\n\n“What was he talking about?” the chief justice asked.\n\nORDER IN THE COURT: A reminder on who’s who: First up today was U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who argued in defense of the Obama administration. Second is lawyer Thomas Saenz, arguing for a group of illegal immigrants who are undocumented mothers of children who are U.S. citizens. After that will be Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller, arguing for the states. The final lawyer will be Erin Murphy, arguing against the administration on behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nJustice Alito adds on: How is it possible, he asks, for an immigrant to be allowed to legally work in the U.S. and yet not be in the U.S. lawfully? “I’m just talking about the English language,” he says.\n\nChief Justice Roberts said the administration in effect was saying that under DAPA, the covered immigrants would be both lawfully present in the U.S., but at the same time technically in violation of the law by being here. It must have been tough to make that argument, the chief justice says.\n\nResuming things chronologically, Solicitor General Verrilli faced some final withering questions from conservative justices before he sat down.\n\nSome quick thoughts before I roll out the next updates: The questions and comments from the justices have signaled little, if any, common ground between the liberal and conservative camps on the court. With just eight justices currently, the court could have an exceeding difficult time resolving this case.\n\nWSJ colleague Brent Kendall will now take over on the live updates. Here’s Brent:\n\nJustice Sotomayor continues on this question of immigrants and policy enforcement resources, adding “they’re here whether we want them or not.”\n\nJustice Ginsburg opens a line of defense for the government, asking how much of a factor it is that there are 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. and Congress has not appropriated funds necessary to deport all of them. (The implication is that this is an implicit endorsement of the administration’s setting of priorities.)\n\nThen, Justice Kennedy has some words that certainly don’t bode well for the government — it seems just “upside down” to suggest that the president, rather than Congress, is dictating a matter of that scope.\n\nThe Obama administration policy, called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, would offer temporary protection from deportation and authorize work permits to about five million undocumented immigrants, most of them parents of U.S. citizens.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy doesn’t think so. He quips that it’s really only “four million from where we are now,” presumably referring to the people who would be shielded from deportation if the government’s action is allowed to go ahead.\n\nJustice Alito has a hypothetical of its own — could anyone challenge the federal government’s decision to open the borders entirely? Yes, the solicitor general says. But that’s “a million miles from where we are now.”\n\nIs it the case, then, that the government’s action is a blanket reprieve for everyone who’s been here for ten years, Roberts wonders.\n\nThese responses from the solicitor general have largely been aimed at the chief justice, who continues to prod about the exact limits of the government’s action. Justice Sotomayor offers a clarifying assist, inviting the solicitor general to suggest some kinds of immigrants who are excluded from the action. Criminals and people who’ve recently entered the country are two such groups, the solicitor general says.\n\nMr. Verrilli starts setting out the government’s case that setting deportation priorities — and putting parents with a clean record at the end of that priorities list — is a matter of discretion that it is allowed to exercise. It’s absolutely not the case, he says, that the government is seeking to issue a deportation reprieve for every immigrant.\n\nAfter more than fifteen minutes, Solicitor General Verrilli is invited to move to some of the other aspects of the case, namely whether the Obama administration was merely exercising its judgment over enforcing the law (in keeping with its executive authority) or setting new law (which would be a problem, because that’s usurping congressional authority.)\n\nLooming large over this standing question is a case in which Massachusetts took on the EPA (and was recognized as having standing.) Chief Justice Roberts says that he sees this situation as being a different one in part because in the Massachusetts case, the state had no way to avoid the environmental impact it argued had arisen from the agency’s actions.\n\nJustices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer sound more supportive of the idea that there are limits on how far states can go in suing the federal government, with Justice Breyer posing a hypothetical of his own — what if the federal government stationed 1 million soldiers in Rhode Island and that tiny state had to grant them all drivers’ licenses, he asks. Justice Breyer continues with a question about putting “the shoe on the other foot” and a scenario in which a state refuses to enforce a federal minimum wage.\n\nJustice Alito is insisting on an answer to the chief’s questions about Texas’s (still hypothetical) refusal to give out licenses to immigrants who get deportation reprieves — and so is the chief.\n\n‘STANDING’: Why are we talking about drivers licenses? As we noted earlier in the blog, the justices are considering a narrow legal issue that amounts to a threshold for bringing a case in court: “standing.” Texas sued the federal government after Obama announced the immigration policy, and its ability to sue rests on its claim that it would be required to subsidize the cost of drivers licenses to people qualifying for the Obama administration’s plan. If the justices feel the case doesn’t have standing, it would send it back to lower courts and potentially provide an opening for the Obama immigration policy to move forward.\n\nHere is a recent court photo. Justice Scalia, in the bottom row, second from left, died earlier this year.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan throws a bone to the solicitor general, wondering if there might be other legal reasons, such as pre-emption, that would prevent the state and federal government from getting into a fight over Texas’s (hypothetical) refusal to grant licenses to immigrants who gain a reprieve from deportation. The solicitor general indicates he’d like to agree with her, but he can’t really do so.\n\nThe chief justice continues to sound less than sympathetic on the idea he should reject Texas’s standing, as the federal government contends. “I just think that’s a real catch 22″ for the state to be told it can’t sue on the basis of having to grant drivers’ licenses, but might itself be sued if it refused to grant them. Mr. Verrilli, for the government, is answering that it’s a “hypothetical” situation at this point, as he will continue to do for the next few minutes.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito — seen by many as sympathetic to the Texas case — jumped in in defense of the state’s standing, quipping that in his eyes, the question over benefits such as drivers’ licenses were “the whole point” of this suit, “isn’t it?”\n\nBut Chief Justice John Roberts, the man whose vote on the standing issue is considered especially critical in deciding the case, was fast to make his interest known too. He soon joined in probing Solicitor General Donald Verrilli on the government’s argument that Texas could not challenge the Obama administration’s action on the basis of the costs it would incur in having to give drivers’ license to immigrants who get a reprieve under it. What if the state refused to give those licenses to immigrants, he began wondering — wouldn’t the state be in a new legal bind with the federal government then?\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was quick off the bat to open a discussion about “standing” that dominated the justices’ questions for more than 15 minutes.\n\nHERE WE GO: Here are the first reports from the oral argument, from Louise Radnofsky.\n\nWe’re standing by for our first reports out of today’s oral argument in the immigration case.\n\nPrior to the immigration argument the court released one opinion in a time-sensitive criminal case, ruling 7-1 a Florida man sentenced to more than a decade in prison for possession of a loaded gun in his home could challenge his sentence.\n\nGregory Welch had three prior felony convictions, qualifying him for enhanced prison time under the Armed Career Criminal Act. The court said a recent opinion defining what types of convictions can trigger longer sentences should apply to Mr. Welch’s case, giving him the chance to reduce his sentence.\n\nAgents apprehended 23,553 unaccompanied minors from Oct. 1 to Feb. 29, almost double the 12,490 in the same months a year earlier. The number of intercepted people in family groups, typically mothers with children, jumped to 27,664, from 11,131 during that five-month period a year earlier. Read more here.\n\nAfter declining in 2015, more unaccompanied minors and families from Central America were apprehended as they crossed illegally into the U.S. during the first five months of the federal fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nAs we wait for the first reports from the court, due around 10:30 a.m., here is some more background on illegal immigration.\n\nHere’s our story from last week about the standing question. Miriam Jordan and Jess Bravin take you through the seemingly mundane but critical question of Texas’s drivers license fees.\n\nFirst up today is U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who will argue in defense of the administration. Second will be lawyer Thomas Saenz, arguing for a group of illegal immigrants who are undocumented mothers of children who are U.S. citizens.\n\nAfter that will be Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller, arguing for the states. The final lawyer will be Erin Murphy, arguing against the administration on behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives. The House took the unusual step of voting to participate in the case, a sign of its intense disagreement with the president’s actions.\n\nToday’s oral argument is scheduled to run 90 minutes, a half-hour longer than the usual case at the Supreme Court. It’s also possible the arguments could run long. In other recent hot-button cases, Chief Justice John Roberts has given the lawyers extra time because the justices asked so many questions.\n\nAmong the questions the court is considering is whether President Obama has violated a constitutional duty to take care that the law is being faithfully executed.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum is a procedural question that potentially could derail the challengers’ case. Before reaching the merits of the dispute, the court must consider whether states like Texas even have a legal right to challenge the Obama administration’s immigration plan.\n\nDespite the high stakes in the case, much of the legal battle in the lower courts focused on mundane issues related to whether the administration followed proper administrative procedures when it announced the DAPA program. As the case comes to the Supreme Court, there are now important constitutional issues at stake.\n\nThere are an estimated 11 million undocumented aliens currently living in the U.S. More than four million of those could be eligible for a reprieve under the Obama administration plan.\n\nA group of 26 states, led by Texas, is challenging the administration’s program, called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, which provides a reprieve to illegal immigrants with children who are U.S. citizens, if they meet certain criteria.\n\nThe challengers prevailed in the lower courts, which blocked implementation of the program.\n\nOur Supreme Court reporter Brent Kendall has some background on the policy and the case.\n\nWe will get updates from our team at the court through the morning, so stay tuned.\n\nThe Supreme Court sits at 10:00 a.m. and is scheduled to hear 90 minutes of arguments in the immigration case. It will first release opinions, then turn to the argument, so is likely to complete the session by noon.\n\nJustice Scalia died in February at age 79.\n\nFollowing the February death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, which left the court with eight justices and increased the chance of 4-4 splits, the court may be looking for a way to reach consensus that won’t deadlock the case. The standing issue—that is whether the Texas driver’s license claim qualifies as such—could offer just such an escape route.\n\nTexas charges $24 for a license, but says it costs nearly $200 to process each application. Because immigrants with temporary status can ask for licenses, “Texas therefore would lose millions of dollars if even a small fraction of DAPA-eligible aliens applied for driver’s licenses,” the state said in a legal brief.\n\nThe justices may focus on a narrow legal issue that amounts to a threshold for bringing a case in court: standing. Texas sued the federal government after Obama announced the immigration policy, and its ability to sue rests on its claim that it would be required to subsidize the cost of drivers licenses to people qualifying for the Obama administration’s plan.\n\nThe argument is over President Barack Obama’s November 2014 executive actions, resulting in new immigration policy. Called the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, it would offer temporary protection from deportation and authorize work permits to about five million undocumented immigrants, most of them parents of U.S. citizens.\n\nThe program is based on a 2012 policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. That program, which would be expanded to include a larger age group, offers the same reprieve to people brought to the U.S. as children, such as Mr. Mercado.\n\nWelcome to our live blog of today’s oral argument on President Obama’s immigration policy.

Who were they, where did they come from and how did they wind up suffocating in a truck? The Times asked me to find out and gave me the resources to follow the trail.\n\nIt led to a question of human psychology: What force compelled so many people into an airless refrigeration chamber? And it ended with a search for just one migrant: Yusuf el-Sheikh, a 39-year-old Syrian businessman from the town of Deir al-Zour, who held the missing piece of the puzzle I wrote about earlier this week.\n\nThe reporting began with Arabic- and Kurdish-speaking researchers for The Times — principally Hwaida Saad in Beirut and Kamil Kakol in Erbil — who saw reports in social media about families notified by the Austrian government that their relatives had died in the truck.\n\nI tried to meet as many of the families as I could — traveling over the course of a week from London to the towns of Mersin and Urfa in Turkey; then the cities of Erbil and Sulaimaniya in the Kurdistan region of Iraq; and finally to Vienna, the provincial capital of Eisenstadt, and the stretch of highway where the truck was discovered in Austria.\n\nI ultimately spoke with relatives of more than a dozen migrants who died on the truck. I met even more in the parking lot outside the Eisenstadt Police Headquarters, where they had come to give DNA samples in the hope of identifying family members and claiming their bodies.\n\nI expected to hear about war, poverty and desperation, but the stories I heard surprised me. Many of the migrants were educated. Some had come from affluent families.\n\nThey took precautions to minimize the risks of their journey. Some told relatives they had crossed the Mediterranean from Izmir, Turkey, to Greece in “a yacht” rather than in an overcrowded raft. Other paid thousands of dollars extra to travel by land through Bulgaria and avoid the sea passage. Still others kept clear of smugglers for much of their journey, until they reached the borders of Hungary.\n\nThe families showed me cheerful photographs and played confident audio recordings that the migrants had sent home over the Internet. Family members recounted detailed conversations with relatives at each step along the way. All the migrants had been aiming for Germany. All had made it safely as far as Belgrade, in Serbia. All had made their last contact some time on the same night, Aug. 25, two days before the truck was discovered on the side of an Austrian highway just inside the Hungarian border.\n\nNone of the families believe that their relatives had willingly entered the truck. They traded rumors that smugglers had drugged the migrants or even killed them before packing them in. In Erbil, the mother of a dead migrant showed me a news photograph of the tangled bodies inside the truck and tried to convince me that a small dot on an arm might be a bullet hole.\n\nThe pictures and audio recordings, though, were more convincing. They seemed so full of life, so far from surrender: Why would any one of these people enter an airless meat truck in which they risked near certain suffocation?\n\nOn previous assignments in Libya, I interviewed migrants who tried to make it by sea. . Human smugglers carry them out from the beaches at night in small rafts to flimsy, overcrowded fishing boats. Some saw the dangers and begged to return to the shore, but the smugglers would not let them. Smugglers cannot allow witnesses to remain behind and, in Libya, they have forced migrants into the boats at gunpoint. Could smugglers in Serbia have used such force to cram the 71 people to the truck found in Austria?\n\nYet none of the migrants reported to their families that their smugglers carried guns. None recalled beatings or threats. Their recorded voices, until their last days, sounded unafraid, even confident. They had nearly reached their final destination.\n\nI emailed my question — Why would anyone have freely entered the back of a meat truck? — to a social psychologist, Stephen D. Reicher of St. Andrews University, who is known for studies of the behavior of crowds under pressure. He sent back an exceptionally thoughtful response, which I will paste here (edited only slightly to correct typos):\n\nThe question you ask is fascinating, and, of course, the short answer is I don’t know. It is always hugely dangerous to try and explain phenomena when you don’t really know the details. It is a bit like asking a doctor to diagnose a patient they haven’t examined and where the symptoms are only hearsay. At the same time, the doctor could say something about the disease and how it works — leaving it open as to whether that applies in the specific case.\n\nSo I can say something in general about some (possibly) relevant processes.\n\nHave you ever had that experience of going into a shop (for me, it is generally a bookshop) just to browse and without the intention of spending any money, then seeing three or four things that are interesting and feeling deeply conflicted about which two to buy — putting any back seems agonizing. Then you leave and realize that you were not particularly concerned about any of the books and quite happy not to have shelled out your hard-earned money on any of them. In other words, the nature of your choices and the value you put on any particular choice changes dramatically according to where you are.\n\nSo, in much more extreme form, when you are deciding whether to leave your country or not, the idea of going into a poorly ventilated truck might seem absurd. It threatens an extreme loss (of life) when you aren’t even convinced of the overall gain of leaving. But then you do make the choice to leave. You are near your destination. Now the choice is very different indeed. It is whether to fail, to have wasted all the efforts (and risks) involved so far or else to take a further risk and to (possibly) succeed.\n\nIn terms of Daniel Kahneman’s classic prospect theory of decision-making, the dilemma of the truck shifts from being taking a big risk to achieve a possible gain (getting to Europe) to taking a risk in order to avoid an otherwise certain loss (failing in one’s attempt to flee). And prospect theory tells us we are far more likely to take the latter risk.\n\nThere is controversy as to why. Is it a cognitive process or a social process? I incline to the latter. On the one hand, having committed oneself to leave makes one a huge failure if one doesn’t succeed. On the other hand, the nearer you get, the more real and the more valuable the gain of getting to the West might seem. Again, to invoke a trivial comparison, if you are in the bookshop deliberating over whether to buy that book, and while you are thinking someone comes along and buys the last copy before you, then suddenly it seems much more desirable.\n\nBut there is another reason that is so. If someone else buys the book it makes it seem like a good bet. Similarly, while you waver about going into the truck and you see others going into it — people like you, people with similar backgrounds and perspectives and values — then that will change your calculations. If they want to go, then the goal must be attractive. If they are prepared to go, perhaps the risks are not what you thought. If they decide to go, space on the trucks becomes a rarer and more valuable resource. In all these ways, what others do is critical to what you do.\n\nSo, over all, I think that these awful and catastrophic decisions are based on ordinary processes of thought. I think we do a final disservice to these people who have died by suggesting that they were desperate, emotional and irrational and that is why they died. That is blaming the victim.\n\nBut I needed a firsthand explanation. I needed to find a migrant who survived such a journey. In Turkey, members of the Sheikh family from Deir al-Zour, Syria, told me that a trick of the smugglers had broken up a group of seven relatives who had traveled together to Belgrade. Four ended up among the 71 in the meat truck.\n\nThree other members of the family had waited in Serbia two days longer, without knowing what became of the others. Then those three — Yusuf el-Sheikh and a teenage niece and nephew — were picked up by the same smugglers, evidently carried along the same route, and somehow survived.\n\nI found Mr. Sheikh by accident, in a temporary apartment in Vienna with a group of other Syrians and Iraqis. They had come to identify bodies, and he had come for the same reason.\n\nTwo of them were Syrian-born physicians married to each other and raising a family in Germany, and as with all the other relatives of the dead migrants they insisted their family members would never have willingly entered the truck.\n\nSo I asked Mr. Sheikh, where had the smuggler taken him? The smuggler led him and about 25 others bound for Germany on a seven-hour walk through the night to a safe house in a Hungarian forest. They had a close brush with the Hungarian police but passed undetected. The following evening the smuggler brought them all to a meeting point where he promised to come back with passenger cars that would take them to Germany.\n\nInstead, the smuggler pulled up with a truck.\n\n“He just came back and said, ‘Get in,’ ” Mr. Sheikh told me.\n\nThe smuggler wanted to pack them standing together without room to sit for what was expected to be a nine-hour drive, and the smuggler would not let them see the face of their driver. Even before he knew about the meat truck, Mr. Sheikh wondered if there would be enough air to breath.\n\n“We just wanted the journey to be over, and we kept asking, ‘Where is our family?’ ” he said. “The smuggler told us, ‘You are going to meet them in Germany.’ ”\n\nIt was what Dr. Reicher might have called “an ordinary process of thought.” Without further coercion, Mr. Sheikh and the 25 others all climbed into the truck.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nSeventy-one anonymous migrants found dead in a meat truck in the middle of Europe.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00006-of-00064--451", "original_text": "When Meg was 12, her mother, Annie, found herself unable to look at her. Seeing her daughter made Annie feel unsettled, at times almost angry. At first, she couldn’t figure out why.\n\n“And then, Meg turned 13 and suddenly, everything slid into place for me,” Annie says.\n\n“I found myself thinking, ‘She’s so tiny. She is so little.’ And I realised I was actually talking about myself, not her.\n\n“It felt like something just broke. It was something big and ugly, and it just broke.”\n\nAnnie was 13 in 1987 when an Anglican priest began sexually abusing her, over a period of eight to 10 months. Seeing her daughter turn the same age was a trigger that not only bring back memories of the abuse, but that also helped her to comprehend just how small and innocent she would have been.\n\nHe was in his mid 30s, and used Annie’s vulnerability after the acrimonious divorce of her parents and his knowledge that she had been sexually abused by a family member to his advantage.\n\nAnnie’s experience of cover-ups, betrayal and being failed by those who should have protected her has become all too familiar in such cases. But it is the experience of her family members she wants to highlight. They are the secondary victims, whose stories are often lost.\n\nAnnie and her family believe abuse pervades the lives of secondary victims but support for them is haphazard and scarce. They hope that by sharing their experiences, religious and other institutions will do more to recognise and address the impact of abuse beyond the primary victim.\n\nMeg said at first she was unsure why her mother had begun to treat her differently. She did not know the extent of her mother’s abuse at the time.\n\n“I guess it was always obvious that something had happened to Mum, because sometimes she would cry or blank out but I didn’t know exactly what she was upset about,” Meg, now 14, says.\n\n“But when I first turned 13 that’s kind of when I knew something more was going on. For a while though, I thought I’d just done something wrong, I thought I’d upset Mum in some way and that’s why she couldn’t really talk to me any more.”\n\nAnnie was first raped when the priest lured her alone into the church where he preached. Knowing that Annie was devastated about the death of her dog, the priest told her that if she looked toward the altar and prayed to God, she would see her beloved pet again. He made her lean towards the pew and, as she did, he pulled down her underwear and sexually abused her.\n\nAnnie’s police statement was made last year, when she was 42.\n\n“After I got home there was a lot of blood there and it hurt for a while,” it said. “For around two weeks, I remember I had a lot of trouble going to the toilet.”\n\nAnnie recalls the priest raping her five times. She is unsure why the abuse eventually stopped. But it she says it robbed her of her childhood and left her without an identity, unable to accept love, her victim impact statement said.\n\nBy the time she was in year 12, Annie had a nervous breakdown. Her former high marks at school crashed. Her mother threw her out of home for several weeks, forcing Annie to steal food from garbage bins to survive.\n\nWhen her mother accepted her back home, Annie was terrified of starving again, and began to eat as much as she could and to hide food in her bedroom. Between 1991 and 1992, Annie gained 30kg.\n\nIn 1994 Annie’s mother made her talk about her withdrawn and surly behaviour to a bishop her mother was friends with.\n\nAnnie brought up the name of her perpetrator to the bishop. He told her: “I’m going to stop you here.”\n\n“I want you to think very carefully about coming forward with this,” Annie recalls him telling her. “Think of the lives that could be ruined by this.”\n\nThe bishop questioned Annie’s memory of what happened and told her that if she told anyone else, people would think she wanted it, that she was partly responsible.\n\nLetters written by church officials at the time and seen by Guardian Australia reveal that senior members of the church knew of the priest’s abusing but did nothing.\n\nAnnie’s mother called her a slut and a whore. She accused her daughter of breaking up the family by causing trouble. Though she was awarded a scholarship to attend a prestigious college in 1994, Annie dropped out after less than a year. That same year, when she was 21, she tried to take her life.\n\nShe has since worked in low-level jobs where people half her age serve as her boss. She cannot go near churches, even for funerals or weddings. She dreads sleep because of the nightmares she knows will come. She has considered and attempted suicide more than once.\n\nAnnie’s husband, Mark, and her three children, Robert,Meg,and Ella, do not know the full extent of her abuse, though they know most of the crucial details. As the years go by, they learn more, sometimes accidentally, such as when Annie talks in her sleep. Or sometimes, by necessity, as the calls from detectives and from the church require an explanation.\n\nDr Judy Courtin, a lawyer representing victims of institutional sex abuse at Angela Sdrinis Legal, published research last year into justice outcomes for sexual assault victims abused within the Catholic church.\n\nShe interviewed 18 secondary victims – defined as immediate family members – and found an admission of guilt by the perpetrator was important to them.\n\n“But an even bigger concern I found from them was their anger at the ongoing way the church concealed the crimes, and a need for those people to also be held to account,” Courtin says.\n\n“They felt that those who knew about paedophiles and yet kept quiet fundamentally enabled the activities of paedophiles. They protected them, they covered up their crimes, and they were often not held to account, and that’s something that really upsets secondary victims. That maybe their family member wouldn’t have been abused if those who knew had spoken up.”\n\n[The church] should also know that the effect isn’t just on that one person\n\nThe finding resonates with Annie’s son, Robert. He learned about the abuse of his mother just before Christmas, after he had finished his year 10 exams. Annie and Mark had been talking to detectives and representatives from the Anglican church and they felt it was time Robert knew what was going on. He is angered most by the fact that no one had helped his mother.\n\n“It’s almost worse, not helping when you can see something is wrong,” Robert says. “I’m a firm believer that if you see or know about something wrong you have to do something. If you hide something like this happening to someone it’s wrong.”\n\n“They [the church] should also know that the effect isn’t just on that one person.\n\n“It’s like a web. Like a spider that keeps on building its web, things like this just keep building. I’m not the only one who has been affected, my friends have, too, even if they don’t know it, because they see how I am affected. They don’t know what the cause is, and they won’t for a while. But they see something is wrong.”\n\nRobert says he feels angry that he cannot always talk about the problem with friends or adults who “think the world is safe and simple”.\n\n“But it’s not. Because sometimes I come home and I’ve got Mum going through this. I’ve got Ella, who doesn’t really know what’s going on, but who is asking questions every day. She’s always confused and always wants to know more. And I’ve got Meg, who is lashing out because of it. And it’s painful at times.”\n\nThere is no support group, no place to go outside his family, Robert says, for other teenagers like him. He thinks a safe environment for other children of survivors to meet and talk in would help. “It’s something I would like to be involved in,” he says.\n\nAnnie has looked into it. But she says there are significant gaps in accessing support and even counselling for survivors and their families. Survivors often have to bear substantial costs of private counselling, while civil claims against the church may also be draining their funds.\n\nAnnie’s husband, Mark, says he learned about Annie’s abuse shortly after they started dating in 1996, though she wasn’t necessarily upfront about it. He would hear her call out in her sleep, and ask her the next morning about some of the things she had said.\n\nOver the years, Annie has gradually told Mark more. Since Annie first told her story to police last year, Mark has learned about the extent her perpetrator went to to harm her. But there were times while giving her statement that Annie would not allow Mark to stay in the room.\n\n“I was very stressed by that,” he says. “There were just two cops and a video camera, and she’s telling them things she doesn’t want me to hear.\n\n“I’m thinking, ‘These are the points where she’s at her most vulnerable and that’s the moment she really needs someone she trusts and knows loves her to be there with her.’\n\n“And there’s stuff I still don’t know,” Mark says.\n\nIt took Annie 19 years of Mark gently encouraging her before she went to police in January last year. Mark had to walk a delicate line between supporting Annie in whatever choice she made, while also navigating his own anger towards the perpetrator and the church.\n\nShe was fearful that if she went to police, Mark would learn the full extent of her abuse, and that knowing the details might prove too much for him to bear. “Mark’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me,” Annie says. “You don’t muck around with that.”\n\nHe replies: “This is what it’s like to be someone who supports a survivor.\n\n“I know what I can’t handle. Of course there are things that will break a human. But this isn’t that. The things that I’m vulnerable to aren’t these things. But despite 20 years of trying, Annie can’t trust me when I say that.\n\n“And that’s my struggle. I’ve got to live with the fact that Annie can’t completely trust me the way I’d like her to, the way I trust her. And I just have to accept that. That’s part of the package. She can’t completely trust me. She can’t completely trust anyone.\n\nIt’s very important that the victim or survivor have control over what happens, and if and when they take action\n\n“She’s still convinced that there are things, when I hear about them, that will be it. “That I’ll never be able to look at her again.”\n\nMark says he feels a certain sense of relief now that Annie’s attacker has been charged with 16 offences. He will face court next month. He had been jailed before, in 1996, for child sexual abuse offences unrelated to Annie.\n\n“I found it’s easier for me since Annie came forward than it was before, because now it’s out in the open. While I’m not telling everyone I know, I feel I can talk about my feelings about how angry I am with the church and the people who covered this up more safely.”\n\nShireen Gunn is the manager of the Centre Against Sexual Assault in Ballarat, a town that has been deeply affected by child sexual abuse within religious institutions.\n\nAs well as primary victims, the centre works with the family members of those who were abused.\n\nDisclosure often comes as a relief to them, she says.\n\n“For many family members of survivors, especially the children of parents who have been abused, everything suddenly makes sense to them once the victim discloses that abuse,” Gunn says.\n\n“Suddenly certain aspects of their childhood or behaviours from their parent start to make sense, it helps them to make sense of their experience.\n\n“The other response from secondary victims is, of course, anger. They want to do something to hold their family member’s perpetrator to account. But it’s very important that the victim or survivor have control over what happens, and if and when they take action or go to police.”\n\nThere is little research on the impact of sexual assault on secondary victims, the Australian Institute of Family Studies says.\n\n“To the extent that secondary victims are considered in the literature, the focus is usually on the manner in which their response to the victim/survivor’s experiences helps or hinders the primary victim’s recovery,” the institute says.\n\n“This is an important concern. Higher levels of unsupportive behaviour by family members has been found to be more likely for sexual assault victims than for victims of non-sexual assaults.” But few studies had examined the trauma experienced by someone finding out a family member had been sexually abused, the institute says.\n\nThe royal commission into institutional responses into child sexual abuse acknowledges the lack of research.\n\nYou have a right to have peace in your life. And you have the right to be able to look at your own kids\n\nA commission spokeswoman told Guardian Australia a comprehensive research program is under way looking at survivors and their families. But the commission does not yet have statistics about how many secondary victims of abuse survivors there might be.\n\n“The research projects under way are exploring a number of questions: what are the impacts of child sexual abuse on families of minors? What are the impacts of child sexual abuse on the intimate partners and children of child sexual abuse survivors? And what are the support needs of the families of child and adult child sexual abuse survivors?” she says.\n\nAnnie says there is not enough acknowledgement of the quiet role secondary victims play in trying to be supportive while grappling with their anger and sadness. While telling her family about the extent of her abuse has been difficult, especially while also repeating her story to members of the church, the royal commission and police, Annie says the experience has ultimately proved worthwhile.\n\n“There is a certain kind of freedom that comes with coming forward,” she says. “The process is flawed, it’s not right, it’s not OK, and survivors and their families deserve better. Supporters need to know the way you say things has the potential to horribly damage a survivor who is already struggling under the weight of coming forward.\n\n“But you can also help amplify a silent voice. I am a person coming forward and coming forward means that you are saying you are a person. You’re not a thing.\n\n“Nobody has the right to use you.\n\n“You’re real. You exist. Your survival means you have the right to peace in your life.\n\n“You have the right to be able to look at your own kids.”\n\n• The names of Meg, Annie and the names of all the family members are pseudonyms.\n\n• The reporter, Melissa Davey, can be contacted at melissa.davey@theguardian.com\n\n• For a list of child sexual abuse support services in Australia click here.

We will file our full response to the original petition with the FCC in short order.”\n\nThe original petitioner, George Washington University Professor John Banzhaf III, used similar legal tactics to help push cigarette advertising off television and radio in 1970. Nightwolf hosts a one-hour show on WPFW (89.3 FM), based in the District and aimed at providing programming for minorities. Grimaldi and Iriarte are producers.\n\nBanzhaf argues that their allegation of harm — if disputed by Snyder — would require a formal FCC hearing. He also said it supports the legal assertions that “Redskin,” repeated over and over on air, constitutes “hate speech” and is also a “fighting word,” and therefore not protected as part of free speech.\n\nBanzhaf said by the end of the month he expects similar challenges to license renewals of at least one station in Los Angeles.\n\n“The commission is reviewing the petition on its merits as it does with all petitions filed with the FCC. No determination has been made,” an agency spokesman said Tuesday.\n\nLast month, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, who has previously called the name “offensive and derogatory,” said his agency would consider the professor’s petition, but legal experts have said the commission is highly unlikely to ban the word or revoke any licenses over its use.\n\n“But whether or not ‘Redskins’ is ‘inappropriate,’ racist, or insulting, I think the FCC is barred by the First Amendment from forbidding it, or from considering its use as a factor in deciding whether to cancel a broadcast license,” UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh recently wrote in the Volokh Conspiracy blog, hosted on The Washington Post.\n\nSteve Lovelady, who according to his biography practices federal communications law and represents “clients in a broad range of regulatory and administrative law issues before the Federal Communications Commission,” recently addressed the issue in a post on commlawblog.com.\n\n“Is there any reason for broadcasters to be concerned about losing their licenses?” he wrote. “As far as we can tell, the answer is clearly: No.”\n\nLovelady cited a 2006 decision in which the FCC narrowly defined the profane language it would regulate: “It imposed on ‘profanity’ a presumption that ‘regulation of profane language will be limited to the universe of words that are sexual or excretory in nature or are derived from such terms.’ Again, ‘Redskins’ does not fit into that universe.”\n\nSECTION: {section=local, subsection=null}!!!

In 2015, Davis (35 carries, 58 yards) became the sixth running back since 1970 to average less than 2.0 yards a carry with at least 35 attempts in a season (the anonymous others: Louis Carter, Reggie Rivers, Lamar Gordon, Odell Lawson and Willie Spencer).\n\nOn Sunday, in a 24-13 loss to the Texans, Davis rushed for 71 yards on five carries, ripping off gains of 44 and 17 yards.\n\nChip Kelly was asked if Davis, a fourth-round pick, looked different than the player he’d seen on video in 2015.\n\nKelly began with a joke (“Yeah, he’s a lot bigger in person”), before acknowledging Davis boosted his chances of making the 53-man roster.\n\n“I knew that he ran behind his pads really well and he’s shown that,” Kelly said. “He’s really put himself in a position for a spot … Some guys really stepped up and really took advantage of that opportunity and some other guys were kind of looking around and kind of caught up in the moment.”\n\nDavis stepped up because he stepped with more burst than he showed in 2015. Davis, listed at 5-foot-9, 217 pounds, isn’t a burner (4.58-second 40), but on Sunday he wasn’t the plodder he resembled as a rookie.\n\n2-8-SF43 (shotgun): Davis right guard pushed ob at HST 13 for 44 yards.\n\nDavis, lined up to the right of QB Thad Lewis, began with a counter move that put him in the middle of the backfield. He then bounced back to the right and ran through a sizable hole created by a seal block from TE Blake Bell and pancake block from RT Trent Brown. Five yards beyond the line of scrimmage, Davis hopped over the would-be shoestring tackles of two defenders and raced down the right sideline.\n\n2-10-HOU 13 (shotgun): Davis left tackle to HST 6 for 7 yards\n\nDavis, lined up the right of Lewis, ran left as he took the handoff and drifted parallel to the line of scrimmage, before cutting hard off his left foot and running decisively downfield.\n\n2-10-HOU 46 (shotgun): Davis right end to HST 43 for 3 yards\n\nDavid, lined up to the right of Lewis, drifted left before cutting hard right. It initially appeared the cutback would net a decent gain, but Lewis got in his way as he carried out a zone-read fake. Lewis appeared to offer a Davis a my-bad tap on the helmet after the play.\n\n2-5-SF 25 (shotgun): M.Davis left tackle to SF 42 for 17 yards\n\nDavis, lined up to the left of Lewis, drifted to the middle of the backfield before cutting hard off his right foot. He avoided a would-be tackler at his feet in the backfield and sprinted into the open field. Said play-by-play man Bob Fitzgerald after the run: “Did Mike Davis just get faster in the offseason?”\n\n2-10-SF 42 (shotgun): Davis right end to SF 43 for 1 yard\n\nDavis, lined up the right of Lewis, cut right and probably would have gained about five yards if he squared his shoulders and ran upfield. Instead, he tried to juke a defender, bounced outside and ran four yards in the wrong direction before he was dragged down by a host of defenders. He’s faster than he was last year, but he’s not fast enough to turn the corner on a run like that.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nPhoto: Tony Avelar, Associated Press Mike Davis take off on his 44-yard run Sunday.

There was no association between gun prevalence and non-firearm homicide.\n\nSource: Miller, Matthew; Azrael, Deborah; Hemenway, David.

Social Science and Medicine. 2007; 64:656-64.\n\nStates with stricter gun control laws have fewer gun-related deaths.\n\nAmericans still kill each other with guns at a level that is staggering compared to the rest of humanity.\n\nA study in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery found that the gun murder rate in the U.S. is almost 20 times higher than the next 22 richest and most populous nations combined.\n\nAmong the world's 23 wealthiest countries, 80 percent of all gun deaths are American deaths and 87 percent of all kids killed by guns are American kids.\n\nAllow me to destroy your little ppints with logic and reason, and other studies with better methodology.\n\n1. Homocide is not murder...it includes justifiable self defenses, accidents, etc.\n\n2. Homocide rates are not higher where there are more guns. In fact suicide and murder rates are lower where there are higher rates of gun ownership. They arrived at that result by ignoring all poor nations, and onlyl ooking at OECD (wealthy) nations. So why not just say poverty causes higher homocide rates? Duh. If they wanted to prove guns = more homocide they'd look at all nations regardless of poverty levels...all they did was prove poverty causes homocide.\n\n3. Again, across states, when you count justifiable homocides and accidents as \"homocide\" you are being disingenuous. The murder rate county by county in the USA is LOWEST in the places with more guns. Studies show urban areas have less guns per capita than rural areas, and have higher murder rates. The same is true of white people vs people of color, and richer people vs poorer. Almost universally, where there are higher gun ownership rates in a group there is lower murder rates.\n\n4. States with more restictive gun laws have lower gun murder rtaes...no crap, genius. Any idiot can figure that out without a study. Where you have more guns you have more GUN murder...but what about crime rates and TOTAl murder trates? Oh, they're HIGHER in those states. You're so worried about gun murder you ignore that it's just one kind of murder, and that murder rates total are higher in your anti-gun States. Think critically for yourself for God's sake.\n\n5. Americans do NOT kill leach other with GUNS more (as in rates - the only stats that matter are rates since they account for population differences). Oh, it seems we are number one in gun ownership, 28th in gun murder, and 110th in total murder rates. Well, there went your points.\n\nThe methodology of studies like you quoted are pre-designed to get a certain result because of the political proclivities of their funders and data gatherers. An honest study is easy to do, even on your own. All you need are total murders, total gun murders, total crimes, total violent crimes, and total suicides, and then divide them by the population. Do this for every nation on Earth 9not just rich nations). Then look at the effect of the Drug War. Here is what you'lll find:\n\nThe Drug War is responsible directly or indirectly for 40%-70% of gun murders and total murders worldwide. It is the most corollary variable of any. Assault rifles and large capaicty magaizines are responsible for less than 2% of gun murders annually, and less than 3.5% of homocides annually (which is an irrelevant stat, but it matches your \"homocide\" criteria so I threw it in there).\n\nYou can save THOUSANDS of lives by legalizing drugs and expanding rights. You MIGHT save a few hundred by further limiting rights via gun control. PERIOD.\n\nThere is no correlation between murder rates and suicide rates and gun ownertship rates transnationally or county by county in the USA. In fact where there are higher gun ownership rates there are LOWER murder and suicide rates. The top 9 gun ownership nations have a 3 times LOWER murder rate and suicide rate than the botttom 9 gtun ownertship rate nations. It's a losing argument for you.\n\nAs a proof of the lack of correlation betwee nhigh gun ownership rates and high murder rates, let me submit the following fact: Our murder rates has been cut in half over the last 30 years and yet the gun pervasiveness, assualt rifles sold, high capacity clips owned, and the permits to carry have risen to hisotric highs. IF THERE IS NO CORRELATION THERE LOGICALLY CAN BE NO CAUSATION.\n\nProof of the illegalization of Drugs causing serious crime, violent crime, and murder rate increases:\n\nCrime rates in Prohibition rose immediately 78%, 24% in just one year from 1920-1921 (the first year)\n\nThe murder rate was cut in nearly half (40% decline), from 10 per 100,000 to 6 per 100,000 when Prohibition ended. This was directly caused by the repeal of Prohibition in 1933.\n\n.026% of gun owners, legal or illegal, murder someone with a gun in America. 99.974% of gun owners kill NO ONE with a gun in America. You as an American have a .0041% chance of being murdered by a gun.\n\nAll those numbers estimate in favor of the anti-gun argument, in terms of total guns in society, total gun owners, population, and murders.\n\nThe whole story is told in the percentage chance a gun owner will murder with a gun - USA is .026%, Canada is .0012%, and England's is .0022%.\n\nAs you can see, Canada has a higher rate of ownership of guns and more total guns than England, and yet has a LOWER gun owner murder rate than England! That means it isn't guns that are the factor making England murder more. So why is Canada so low, while England is nearly double that? Why is the USA more than 10 times higher than England? All of this is adjusted for population and total guns in society...so what is the factor making us so much more prone to murder (even if it is a tiny threat overall to life) here in the USA?\n\nMore lives are saved annually by far by guns than are taken by guns. Estimates are as low as a few tens of thousands lives saved, up to 2.5 million lives saved annualy. Even if you go with the owest estimates via studies, you still have a NET GAIN of life, not a net loss. Again, this is demonstrated by the lack of correlation between gun ownership rates and murder rates.\n\nIf only 2% of the 750,000 crimes prevented by private guns (FBI stat) save one life (or 1% saves 2 lives, etc.), then more lives are saved than taken. BTW...sutdies show many more than that are saved by guns...the estimate by Clinton Administration study was 2 million lives per year...which might be high...and other more intensive studies show the number to be in the tens of thousands, up to 200,000, per year. But EVEN IF the number was only 15,000 as I suggested with my 2% number, we're still looking at more lives saved than murdered.\n\nA study done by the Harvard Jounal of Law and Public Policy reports some interesting statistics.\n\nThe study, which appeared in Volume 30, Number 2 of the Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy (pp. 649-694), set out to answer the question in its title: \"Would Banning Firearms Reduce Murder and Suicide? A Review of International and Some Domestic Evidence.\" Contrary to conventional wisdom, and the sniffs of our more sophisticated and generally anti-gun counterparts across the pond, the answer is \"no.\" And not just no, as in there is no correlation between gun ownership and violent crime, but an emphatic no, showing a negative correlation: as gun ownership increases, murder and suicide decreases.\n\nThe findings of two criminologists - Prof. Don Kates and Prof. Gary Mauser - in their exhaustive study of American and European gun laws and violence rates, are telling:\n\nNations with stringent anti-gun laws generally have substantially higher murder rates than those that do not. The study found that the nine European nations with the lowest rates of gun ownership (5,000 or fewer guns per 100,000 population) have a combined murder rate three times higher than that of the nine nations with the highest rates of gun ownership (at least 15,000 guns per 100,000 population).\n\nFor example, Norway has the highest rate of gun ownership in Western Europe, yet possesses the lowest murder rate. In contrast, Holland's murder rate is nearly the worst, despite having the lowest gun ownership rate in Western Europe. Sweden and Denmark are two more examples of nations with high murder rates but few guns. As the study's authors write in the report:\n\nIf the mantra \"more guns equal more death and fewer guns equal less death\" were true, broad cross-national comparisons should show that nations with higher gun ownership per capita consistently have more death. Nations with higher gun ownership rates, however, do not have higher murder or suicide rates than those with lower gun ownership. Indeed many high gun ownership nations have much lower murder rates. (p. 661)\n\nIt appears there is also NO correlation between single parenthood, violent video games, movies, TV shows, music, one religion or another (or lack thereof), etc.\n\nLike guns, those are just NOT causal to high gun murder rates, despite the illogic used to say they are. (To be clear, it is intuitive to think guns and these other things cause the problem...but there is NO factual basis for it, and the factual nature of things is often deductively logical, and counter-intuitive.) If these things were responsible, then like guns, how are they so proliferated over the last 30 years to record highs, and yet we have lower murder rates simultaneously? It's nonsense, of course, to believe guns or any of these things are causal to murder rates.\n\nAre you considering backing gun control laws? Do you think that because you may not own a gun, the rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment don't matter?\n\nIn 1929 the Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929 to 1953, approximately 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915-1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, 13 million Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, the mentally ill, and others, who were unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one million \"educated\" people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. That places total victims who lost their lives because of gun control at approximately 56 million in the last century. Since we should learn from the mistakes of history, the next time someone talks in favor of gun control, find out which group of citizens they wish to have exterminated.\n\nMe: And That's The Rest of the Story!\n\nThe intent of the 2nd Amendment was to arm individual citizens, not just members of militias, so they could overthrow a tyrannical government. Every Founder said this and only this, except Adams (who still wanted individuals armed, but only for self defense, and he thought militias must follow the orders of tyrants regardless because he was a law fetishist as opposed to someone more agianst tyranny and for liberty even if it meant breaking tyrannical laws). Some people have suggested to me other false revisionist history nonsense, and so I leave this link full of other links and facts to prove the case. If further necessary I will start quoting the Founders and challenging them to match me quote for quote (which they can't).\n\nThe most important links on that site are these ones:\n\n\"Is there Contrary Evidence of an Individual Right?\"\n\n\"Quotes from the Founding Fathers and Their Contemporaries\"\n\nGood luck defeating that with some semantical trick about the wording or puncuation of the 2nd Amendment. They mispelled words in the Constitution too...I suppose next you'll argue we have somehow mistakenly mispelled words all these years and the Constitution had them right all these years? Enough with the illogic and irrationale...non sequiturs are not logical arguments.\n\n(Prohibition and Homicide Rates) \"The data are quite consistent with the view that Prohibition at the state level inhibited alcohol consumption, and an attempt to explain correlated residuals by including omitted variables revealed that enforcement of Prohibitionist legislation had a significant inhibiting effect as well.

The researchers found that: \"Our results probably explain reports of increased injection drug use, drug-related crime and other public-order concerns in neighbourhoods where activities related to illicit drug use and the sex trade emerged or intensified in the wake of the crackdown. Such displacement has profound public-health implications if it \"normalizes\" injection drug use among previously unexposed at-risk youth. Furthermore, since difficulty in obtaining syringes has been shown to be a significant factor in promoting syringe sharing among IDUs in Vancouver, displacement away from sources of sterile syringes may increase the rates of bloodborne diseases. Escalated police presence may also explain the observed reduction in willingness to use a safer injection facility.33 It is unlikely that the lack of benefit of the crackdown was due to insufficient police resources. Larger crackdowns in the United States, which often involved helicopters to supplement foot and car patrols, have not had measurable benefits and have instead been associated with substantial health and social harms.\"\n\nSource: Wood, Evan, Patricia M.

It is in these neighborhoods where the police make most patrols, and where they stop and search the most vehicles and individuals, looking for \"contraband\" of any type in order to make an arrest. The item that people in any neighborhood are most likely to possess, which can get them arrested, is a small amount of marijuana. In short, the arrests are ethnically- and racially-biased mainly because the police are systematically \"fishing\" for arrests in only some neighborhoods, and methodically searching only some \"fish.\"6 This produces what has been termed \"racism without racists.\"\n\nSource: Harry G.

But if you want to save about half (or more) of the lives yearly taken via murder, legalize drugs, and stop going after guns which can only, at best, decrease the murder rate less than 2%.\n\nSo more guns does NOT equal more homocide. Looking at wealthy nations doesn't prove that at all...it's cherry picking the stats that are also included in the Law Journal study that was quoted by me. And why are they only looking at \"high income nations\" when looking transnationally? Because it fits their preconceived concusions...it's cherry picking (probably subconsciously). Why are they accounting for incomes but not saying \"poverty causes more murder\" (knowing that poverty is associated with increased incentive to join the drug trade)? Because what they're doing is (I hope, unintentionally) sophistic. If they really wanted to prove their conclusion scientifically they wouldn't control for incomes, they'd look at only gun ownership across all nations. Afterall, they are claiming more guns equal more homocide....so prove THAT. They can't, and they know it (on some level). They only way to fix the stats to get a desired outcome is to eliminate poverty stricken nations (compartatively), add in accidental homicides (at least at someone else's hands), and justifiable self defensive homocides (as opposed to only looking at MURDER RATES and SUICIDE RATES). They are expecting people who already agree with them, like yourself, not to think critically about how they set up the study...or perhaps they even fooled themselves.\n\nHere is a pro-gun control person pointing out ownership rates are not causual (which somehow doesn't stop him from wanting more gun control...lol). Of all my links I really suggest you read this one. He didn't even exam the drug war effects, so once you see what he has done you can then add in my look at the Drug War, and if you have an open mind (which I sort of doubt based upon your statements thusfar), see the real cause of the problem. He points out the methodological issues in many stats that float around out there that seem to suggest guns are the problem...although he doesn't point out the ones i'm pointing out necessarily. Because he didn't look at the criticisms i'm levying, and didn't look at the Drug War's effects, I disagree with his conclusion (which is sort of counter logical, imho):\n\nGuns are (probably) not responsible for the high murder rates in the US: how to understand the stats\n\nThe rural vs urban, white vs black, etc. facts via economist Sowell:\n\nWhen it comes to the rate of gun ownership, that is higher in rural areas than in urban areas, but the murder rate is higher in urban areas. The rate of gun ownership is higher among whites than among blacks, but the murder rate is higher among blacks. For the country as a whole, hand gun ownership doubled in the late 20th century, while the murder rate went down.\n\nThe causes of high murder rates:\n\n1. Drug Wars. This is the most correlated factor in every country.\n\n2. Domestic violence. This is overwhelmingly correlated to wars...so stop going to war so much when it isn't direct self defense. Vets have FAR higher domestic violence rates, and they end up in prison far more than everyone else. Also, their kids commit crimes at higher rates. This means one generation's war in the next generation's crime wave. This is why cops have higher domestic violence rates than normal people like vets do! So limit wars, you limit crime and murder.\n\n3. Poverty. The more free market an nation they less poverty (objective poverty). So allow the markets to be free-er, and stop being so anti-free markets. Educate yourselves in Austrian economics and stop believing these Keynesians who totally failed to predict the housing collpase and the collpase of the economy.\n\n4. No-gun zones. Again, where there are less guns there is more murder. All but one mass shooting in the last 60 years have occured in places where gns were banned or limited (it was Gabby Giffords shooting). Fort Hood was a no gun zone for everyone but MPs, and he struck where they weren't. Columbine had armed guards, but teacherts and other adults were deprived of their gun rights on campus...and the shooters knew that. These guys, mass shooters (refered to by psychologists as \"active shooters\") purposefully pick no gun zones because they want to inflict as high a body count as possible before being killed or killing themselves. They often kill themselves when the first gun in opposition arrives on the scene...even if that gun is never fired. I'd remind you, the peak of mass murder rates were in 1929. It has been declining ever since, despite your skewed perspective due to media coverage being more active and pervasive.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\n1.

Not sure how to get into, improve, reinvent or get out of a relationship? You obviously haven’t been watching enough television. With all due respect to “Fifty Shades of Grey” on its debut weekend, it’s the “50 Ways” song that comes to mind here, with 50 TV shows standing ready to help you meet, retain, change, impress or leave your lover:\n\nLOSE THE KEY, LEE? The most educational relationship-related show on television is TLC’s outlandish “Sex Sent Me to the ER.” Last Saturday’s episode included an incident summarized in publicity materials as: “A doctor is perplexed by a man’s chastity-belt injury.”\n\nNOT IN THE TRUCK, CHUCK If it doesn’t get you hospitalized, sex will get you arrested: Investigation Discovery has just rolled out a series called “Sex Sent Me to the Slammer.” Friday’s installments include vignettes titled “D.U.I. Love You,” “Real Bad Lieutenant” and “Flatbed Floozy.”\n\nTAKE OFF YOUR PANTS, NANCE The VH1 show “Dating Naked” removes the mystery right from the get-go: Two strangers meet each other naked, then go on a date.\n\nGO INCOGNITO, VITO The opposite of “Dating Naked” is “Sexy Beasts,” which begins Saturday on A&E. Would-be couples meet in disguises so heavy there’s no clue what they actually look like, so that inner beauty can be the selling point. Hey, it’s more honest than most online dating profiles.\n\nTAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD, CHAD The Discovery Channel’s “Naked and Afraid” is a survival show, not a dating show, but when two survivalists meet each other nude, you never know what might happen. Or not happen. In an episode last season, almost as soon as naked Hakim met naked Phaedra, he got to watch her have an extended case of dysentery.\n\nSTOP AT ONE, SON Speaking of shattered illusions, “Sister Wives,” TLC’s polygamy show, might make men with multiple-partner fantasies pause to consider the maintenance issues. On a recent episode, one polygamist husband told another, “If my wife feels jealous of my other wife, that’s my fault.”\n\nIT’S A TWO-WAY STREET, CLEET “Sister Wives” seem a bit sexist? For two seasons Showtime’s “Polyamory: Married & Dating” gave us a more equal-opportunity multiple-partner philosophy. Everyone got to dabble. But there was just as much whining, sulking and fighting as on any other show.\n\nHOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW, FLO? Polyamory, by the way, is one subject you can learn about on the peppy YouTube channel “Sexplanations With Dr. Doe,” featuring Lindsey Doe, who calls herself a clinical sexologist. Take her Sexplanations Quiz if you want to find out what ithyphallophobia is.\n\nHURL A LIMB, JIM Aviva Drescher made news last year on “The Real Housewives of New York City” when she threw her prosthetic leg across a restaurant. Last week her husband made news on “Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars” when he threw a fake leg at her during a role-playing exercise.\n\nSAVOR THE BLISS, CHRIS And, by the way, here is WE TV’s description of the original “Marriage Boot Camp,” in case your definition of “true love” and “hell” are the same: “ ‘Marriage Boot Camp’ features five outrageous Bridezillas and their husbands living together in the same house.”\n\nDON’T PITCH A FIT, BRITT What? You say the original “Bridezillas” was canceled after only 10 seasons? Where will our young women look for role models?\n\nMORE IS LESS, JESS Somehow, viewers have yet to tire of “The Bachelor,” ABC’s long-running hook-’em-up show. Headline on an Internet item about Monday’s episode: “Ashley I. Faces Off Against Kelsey on ‘Shocking’ 2-on-1 Date.”\n\nEXPECT TO FAIL, DALE Somehow, viewers also have yet to tire of “The Bachelorette,” ABC’s other long-running hook-’em-up show. Last season’s engagement lasted until January. “It’s family and friends who pick us up when we fall down,” Andi Dorfman, the platitudinous but still loveless Bachelorette, wrote on Instagram.\n\nTRUST IN GOD, ROD Last year GSN rolled out “It Takes a Church,” which turned houses of worship into dating parlors. The congregation helps pick a date for a loveless parishioner. Season 2 starts next month.\n\nKNEEL AND PRAY, FAY “It Takes a Church” was brought to us by a partnership with ChristianMingle.com, the online dating service. And on Sunday, in case you missed the point, the Up network (“America’s favorite network for uplifting entertainment”) broadcast the TV premiere of “Christian Mingle: The Movie.” GO TO CHURCH, LURCH Last week WE TV jumped on the love-and-religion bandwagon with “Match Made in Heaven.” It’s a basic bachelor’s-choice series featuring a guy named Shawn, with this wrinkle: Shawn is being counseled by “Pastor Ken Johnson,” the “spiritual adviser to the Indianapolis Colts.”\n\nTOO SÉANCEY, CHAUNCEY? Last month Oxygen brought us “Living Different,” profiling “women who are unrestricted by social norms.” One of them, explaining a failed relationship, said, “We broke up because I came out as a psychic medium.”\n\nBE A PILL, BILL On Saturday “Impractical Jokers,” the TruTV hidden-camera prank show, is offering a marathon of its dating-themed bits. It once did a gag in which a guy (the plant) hurled rapid-fire questions at a woman he had just met, speed-date style. His third question: “Do you give lap dances?”\n\nCLIMB IN A BOX, ROX If you think counseling and overexposure would help your relationship, WE TV has a show for you, starting Feb. 27: “Sex Box.” You and your partner get into a soundproof box and have sex while a studio audience waits, presumably in the world’s most awkward silence. When you come out, experts ask you questions and give advice, which may or may not include, Don’t have sex in a box in front of a live audience.\n\nBETTER HIT THE GYM, KIM A new season of TLC’s continuing chronicle of marital garishness, “My Big Fat American Gypsy Wedding,” begins Feb. 26, promising the most “bling-tastic dresses to date,” including one that weighs more than 100 pounds.\n\nDON’T FORGET THE VEIL, GAYLE Speaking of dresses, TLC’s “Say Yes to the Dress” returns for its zillionth season next month. Because never mind love, devotion, honesty, trust, affection. It’s all about the gown.\n\nAND THE LACE, GRACE Did we mention “Say Yes to the Dress: Atlanta”? Repeat: It’s all about the gown.\n\nAND YOUR POSSE, FLOSSIE Another spinoff: “Say Yes to the Dress: Bridesmaids.” Quote from an exchange seen in a trailer for the show: “You look like a huge heifer.”\n\nMAKE A TRADE, JADE Don’t bother watching ABC’s “Celebrity Wife Swap”; just savor the quirky pairings. Last season David Justice, the former New York Yankee, traded with the musician Dweezil Zappa; the comic Judy Gold swapped with the magician Penn Jillette; and the rapper DJ Paul switched with Plaxico Burress, the former football star.\n\nGOT A VISA, LISA? Politicians talk about immigration policy, but TLC is doing something about it. Its “90 Day Fiancé” looks at mixed couples — one foreign, one American — contemplating marriage as the 90-day immigration clock ticks.\n\nSTART WITH THE RING, BING Season 2 of FYI’s “Married at First Sight” begins next month. Yeah, it’s just what it sounds like.\n\nNOW WHAT DO YOU DO, SUE? If there’s a “Married at First Sight,” there of course has to be a “Married at First Sight: The First Year.” There is. It follows two couples who tied the knot in the original show as they come up to their first anniversary.\n\nTRY THE TILT-A-WHIRL, GIRL Last month an episode of the preposterous TLC series “My Strange Addiction” was promoted with this description: “For the past three years, 56-year-old Linda has been happily married to ‘Bruce,’ a 70-foot and 60-ton carnival ride.”\n\nUSE THE APP, CAP The GSN network is developing the show “Face 2 Face,” which it describes as “a studio-based dating series for the 21st century, using an app to drive a tailored search for each contestant’s (dater) ideal physical ‘type.’ ” Swell, but isn’t that basically the way millions of people already date?\n\nTAKE IT SLOW, JO “Thicker Than Water,” a Bravo show about the religious Tankard family of Tennessee, is brimming with advice on romance, most of it aimed at the Tankard children. Last Sunday, in the Crossover Episode From Hell, Phaedra Parks of Bravo’s “Real Housewives of Atlanta” stopped by long enough to tell 18-year-old Cyrene, “Some girls don’t know the value of their vaginas.” Then she added: “It’s a powerful instrument. You just have to use it wisely.”\n\nEVERYONE HAS FLAWS, DAWES Among the more mind-blowing dating shows around is GSN’s “Baggage,” hosted by Jerry Springer. A dater gets to choose among three possible dates, but each has baggage. In one recent episode, a man has three women to choose from: one whose religion is Greek mythology, one who likes to chew her date’s food and one who claimed to need sex five times a day. That’s a choice?\n\nHOP ON THE BUS, GUS Last month came “Baggage on the Road.” Same as above, only Mr. Springer is in motion, to places like Austin, Tex., and Baton Rouge, La.\n\nDON’T JUDGE, PUDGE In the Feb. 27 season opener of “Unlikely Animal Friends” on Nat Geo Wild, we hear about Mr. G (a goat) and Jellybean (a donkey) at an animal sanctuary in California who are inexplicably close. “They graze all day together, they sleep in the sun together, they spend the entire day together,” a caretaker says. Oh, stop, you sickos. It’s a perfectly sweet story.\n\nMAKE SURE IT’S ALIVE, CLIVE Discovery’s adorable penguin documentary “Waddle All the Way” had a lesson for all would-be lovers. It used a penguin cam — a camera hidden in a lifelike penguin robot. Real penguins tried to hook up with the fake one.\n\nLEAVE IT TO THE KID, SID Last year NickMom introduced “Undercover Cupid,” a show in which teenagers set up their unsuspecting single parents on dates. Cue the “Forbidden Broadway” version of “Matchmaker” from “Fiddler on the Roof.”\n\nRECYCLE, MICHAEL On “The Challenge: Battle of the Exes 2,” an MTV series, onetime couples from other youthful shows are paired again, but as partners in extreme physical competitions. Why? Because young people and, apparently, reality-show viewers enjoy being tortured.\n\nPURPLE YOUR PROSE, ROSE On TLC’s new, moderately raunchy talk show “All About Sex,” a guest named Mistress Susan recently advised women on how to spice things up. “As soon as your man comes home,” she said, “just say one thing: ‘Hey there, nasty boy.’ ”\n\nSTAY CLEAN, GENE “The Legend of Mick Dodge” on the National Geographic Channel has little to do with love — it’s about a hairy guy who has lived in the woods for 25 years — but that didn’t stop the show’s publicity arm from issuing Valentine’s Day advice. It suggested following Mick’s romance regimen, including “a mud and moss facial and, of course, a brush of the teeth with a pinecone.”\n\nDON’T STINK, LINC “Discovering Lucy Angel,” an AXS reality show about a family country music trio, also made a foray into advice-giving. Among its suggestions for making love last: “Be your best attractive self and always smell good.”\n\nTHERE’S NO ROSE GARDEN, ARDEN The trailer for the new season of Bravo’s “Newlyweds: The First Year,” which follows assorted gay and straight couples, is 2 minutes 23 seconds long. Roughly half of that is devoted to clips of the couples arguing.\n\nCONSIDER REFORMIN’, NORMAN Scripted shows are not our interest here, but the Valentine’s Day promotional material sent out by “Bates Motel,” A&E’s “Psycho” prequel, cannot be ignored. It included a creepy valentine from Norman Bates to his mother, as well as candy hearts with phrases like “2gether 4Ever” on them. Season 3 starts March 9.\n\nCASH OR CHARGE, MARGE? The online store for the borderline-pornographic Showtime reality series “Gigolos” — guess what it’s about? — sells a women’s T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase, “They’re definitely worth it.”\n\nSTRIVE FOR CLARITY, CHARITY TruTV’s “Breaking Greenville” concerns rival TV journalists in Mississippi, several of whom are looking for love. In the Feb. 26 episode, one of them, an older gent, is embarrassed to learn that at his age, when you ask a woman if she’s “available,” she thinks you’re talking about a job opening.\n\nANY ROOM WILL DO, STU In the trailer for the new season of “Shahs of Sunset,” a Bravo reality show about some loud-living Persian-Americans that returns March 2, someone says, “There will be sex in the Champagne Room.”\n\nRETHINK THE WEB, JEB Cracked.com has just posted Season 2 of its hilariously droll web series “Rom.Com,” which is about a dating website and its employees. These dot-com clowns, though fictional, may just cause you to revert to old-school dating: i.e., hooking up with your co-workers or college professors.\n\nCHANGE YOUR ZONE, JOAN Bravo’s “Friends to Lovers” follows pairs of friends — opposite-sex and same-sex — who are thinking of becoming romantic. How can you tell if your gal pal wants something more? “So, I’m pretty much thinking that we’re out of the ‘friend zone’ right about now,” observes Stefan when his friend Marshana enters the room wearing only come-hither underwear.\n\nBE WARY, LARRY Sometimes a reality show’s title is a cautionary tale all by itself.

Cranes, bulldozers and dump trucks motored around as he put stakes in the ground by a fence. He wore dark sunglasses, a gold chain and construction boots, and pointed toward mounds of rock and dirt that lined four back lots. He noted a clearing where former Patriot Aaron Hernandez pumped six bullets into Odin Lloyd in 2013. It will soon be paved over as a road into a commercial subdivision featuring four new buildings. He noted that Hernandez’s house stood through the trees. He took a drag.\n\n“Tough winter,” DiLoreto said. “Gotta move dirt.”\n\nLloyd, a landscaper, knew the job well.

A local jogger discovered him lying on his back that afternoon, LeBron James sneakers on his feet, a red Red Sox hat five feet from his head. During Hernandez’s 10-week murder trial, first responders detailed the murder scene, testifying about gnats flying in and out of Lloyd’s nostrils as they took note of the area around his bullet-riddled body, his stiff corpse surrounded by scattered fox feces. To preserve the evidence, from tire tracks to shell casings, law enforcement propped up a tent. Wind picked up; temperatures fell. Hard rain came.\n\n“To cover the entire crime scene we would have needed a circus tent,” North Attleborough police detective Joseph Direnzo said.\n\nRELATED: AARON HERNANDEZ FOUND GUILTY IN MURDER OF ODIN LLOYD\n\nA double rainbow emerged over the tree line that evening, but Lloyd’s mother, Ursula Ward, didn’t believe the sun shone down on her until Wednesday. She sat in Courtroom 7 at the Fall River Justice Center when Hernandez, standing among his attorneys, listened to the jury forewoman’s guilty verdict. He was told to sit down in a swivel chair so that his hands and ankles could be shackled. Hernandez complied, his harrowing fall complete with him being convicted of first-degree murder, the jurors reasoning “extreme atrocity or cruelty” for a crime that carried mandatory life in prison without parole. Ward trembled when the verdict came. She recalled anger and pain, saying she wanted to join Lloyd in his grave when he was buried.\n\n“My baby — just like God has left his footprint in the sand, my baby’s footprint is in my heart forever,” she said.\n\nHernandez, linked to the scene by footprints and DNA, was committed to the Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Walpole, Mass., as inmate W106228 for what he did by Corliss Landing. The jury — seven women and five men — agreed with prosecutors that Hernandez, joined by two confederates, killed Lloyd in a brutal manner. The autopsy determined that Lloyd was shot in the back, one bullet recovered by his buttocks. Gunshot wounds were identified in the right abdomen and right forearm. Two .45-caliber bullets penetrated his body by the nipples, one projectile piercing his heart. Three of the shots were fatal. Ward winced at all of it, but lead prosecutor William McCauley circled back to the scene in his closing after defense attorney James Sultan offered that Hernandez witnessed Lloyd’s murder.\n\n“He didn’t know what to do, so he just put one foot in front of the other,” Sultan said.\n\nRELATED: HERNANDEZ SPENDS TIME IN JAIL CELL JUST MILES FROM PATRIOTS' GILLETTE STADIUM\n\nMcCauley, his tone rising from polite to nearly apoplectic when he spoke, countered, pointing at Hernandez repeatedly, referring to him only as “this guy.”\n\n“Ask yourself first of all... what was the purpose in going to, what I’m going to suggest to you is, the most ideal place to commit a murder?” he said. “An industrial park. Nobody is around, it’s almost 3:25 in the morning.”\n\nThe jurors noted they were “shocked” Sultan placed his client at the scene. It was one more shot to Hernandez’s credibility. Most of the jurors laughed when asked afterward whether they believed the testimony of Hernandez’s fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, who allegedly spirited the murder weapon out of their shared house the day after the murder. The jurors also did not assign much value to the PCP testimony introduced by the defense, an attempt to pass blame to Hernandez’s co-defendants, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, who drove to his house when beckoned by text message. No defense machinations could put the bullets back in the gun.\n\n“The shots. There were six of them,” said Rosalie Oliver, 56, an accounts payable manager from Rehoboth, Mass. “That’s extreme.”\n\nNo matter the motive, Hernandez’s actions reflected a depraved approach. His halcyon days — a Super Bowl touchdown pass from Tom Brady, his name announced in Boston nightclubs (“Aaron Hernandez in the house!”), Patriots employees facilitating his finding a flophouse — grew more distant as the trial trudged along, through blizzards and a bomb threat. Testimony elicited by the prosecutors traced the trajectory of his quick descent, showing him to be an incorrigible cad, chain-smoking marijuana, cheating on his fiancée and questioning whom he could trust. Inebriated and high the night of the murder, clues led right to his mansion’s door.\n\n“The fact that he was a professional athlete meant nothing in the end,” Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn said.\n\nRELATED: AARON HERNANDEZ ON SUICIDE WATCH: REPORT\n\nFrom this point on, hard work will be required for all involved. Ward started the healing process by forgiving Hernandez, but there will be more families seeking justice. The burden of proof shifted to Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley to show jurors Hernandez emptied bullets from a .38-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver into two men when Hernandez stands trial for a 2012 double homicide later this year. Hernandez’s reputation was razed in Fall River, but a new case will have to be built to withstand his defense’s tests once again.\n\nDiLoreto talked about the road ahead, too, targeting his first building’s construction by December. He noted that town officials stopped by once in a while to inquire about permit issues, but his company was cleared by the sheriff’s department to build at the murder scene for a while now. The workers kicked everything into high gear once the snow melted and the trial approached its end. DiLoreto eyed the dirt where Lloyd’s body once laid still.\n\n“Hopefully this will all be gone by winter,” DiLoreto said. “Hopefully.”\n\nRobert Kraft, the billionaire owner of the Patriots, walked through a metal detector inside the courthouse, a building where all of his team’s merchandise had been banned, per judge’s orders, so as not to influence jurors. It was half past 9 a.m. on March 31. A court officer asked Kraft to spread his arms out wide and waved a hand-held scanner slowly over his suit, first in front, then in back, as an onlooker photographed Kraft with his phone. Kraft, greeted by two Massachusetts State Police Troopers, gave the photographer a side-eye glance before proceeding to the fifth floor to testify to what he knew. Kraft, huddling with counsel, awaited his cue.\n\n“Your honor, if I could call the next witness, Robert Kraft, please,” McCauley said.\n\nHernandez, known for smiling and strutting as a dimpled, dapper defendant, appeared anxious. Kraft remained outside a minute longer, but Hernandez, growing curious, craned his neck six times to catch a first look of the man who once awarded him a contract worth up to $40 million. Kraft, slowed by a head cold, trailed court officer Ralph Tavares, a 72-year-old Grammy winner for singing “More Than A Woman” on the “Saturday Night Fever” soundtrack, through double doors. Kraft, in pink tie and white-collar shirt, wore black sneakers with white soles as he hurried.\n\n“Just follow you?” Kraft said.\n\n“Straight to the podium,” Tavares said.\n\nKraft’s football team won its fourth Lombardi Trophy nearly two months earlier. He was asked to identify Hernandez in court, and Kraft did so. Hernandez wore a suit and tie, but he also donned AFC Championship gear as a Patriot three years earlier. That was the height of his life as a professional, before he slipped on a green jumpsuit emblazoned with inmate No. 174954 on it, and slept in a 7-foot-by-10-foot cell in the Bristol County House of Correction for 20 months. It was before Bills fans wore orange jumpsuits with his surname and No. 81 stenciled in black when the Patriots played their first game after his incarceration. It was February of 2012, a time when Hernandez was hailed as a hero, his hometown of Bristol, Conn. heaping praise on him, his face appearing via a pre-taped message to a student assembly.\n\n“Have a great future,” Hernandez said at the time. “Make sure you listen to all your teachers, do good in school and hopefully the best happens to you.”\n\nThat was inside the South Side School’s gymnasium, days before his Super Bowl debut against the Giants, 820 miles west in Indianapolis. His mother, Terri, a widow, wore a T-shirt with “Go Patriots!” on the front. She donned a sash, decorated with “Super Bowl Mom” on it. There were flowers, and tears flowed. She tried to explain his ascent, from celebrated star at Bristol Central to the University Florida to New England.\n\n“My son’s playing in the Super Bowl,” she said. “My God.”\n\nRELATED: NFL PLAYERS EXPRESS SHOCK AT HERNANDEZ GUILTY VERDICT\n\nHernandez stepped onto the game’s biggest stage in stride. He scored a 12-yard touchdown, flashing his make-it-rain celebration, motioning as if throwing cash in the air at a strip club. Despite defeat, he dashed into the offseason, welcoming more money from Kraft’s pockets when he signed the five-year contract that August. It was a reward for his ability to break free, a perfect complement to fellow tight end Rob Gronkowski. Hernandez and Gronkowski moved the chains at historic rates, but Hernandez was going too fast, smoking marijuana at a prodigious rate, burning through associates as sources for marijuana, according to Alexander Bradley, a former friend who transitioned from a business relationship to friend in time. Hernandez played to Kraft’s pride, insisting he was grateful Kraft’s coach, Bill Belichick, drafted him in the fourth round after falling due to character questions. One evaluation noted Hernandez lived “on the edge of acceptable behavior.” He insisted Foxborough transformed him, forced him to mature more than previously.\n\n“You can’t come here and act reckless and do your own stuff,” Hernandez said. “I might have acted the way I wanted to act, but you get changed by Bill Belichick’s way. You get changed by the Patriots’ way.”\n\nKraft eventually caught Hernandez in a lie and told the court the details. Prosecutors questioned the owner about his meeting with Hernandez in the days after the murder. It was just outside the weight room inside Gillette Stadium’s bowels. Kraft hustled down from his office when he heard Hernandez, already a suspect by then, was in the building. Media helicopters hovered. Kraft asked Hernandez if he was involved and whether he needed assistance. Hernandez denied being at the scene. He gave Kraft his regular hug-and-kiss embrace, telling the owner “he hoped that the time of the murder. . . came out because I believe he said he was in a club.” Jonathan Carlson, a juror, called the testimony “compelling.”\n\n“To this day — we just went through a three-month trial, and this is now two years later — we still don’t know the exact time of Odin’s murder,” Carlson said. “So I don’t know how Aaron would have had that information two years ago.”\n\nRELATED: HERNANDEZ TIMELINE: FROM NHL STAR TO CONVICTED MURDERER\n\nJurors never heard from Kraft about Hernandez’s divorce from the team. Kraft was not asked about Hernandez being released within an hour of being arrested or the jersey exchange that Kraft held at Gillette Stadium, fans wrapping around the building’s side on a weekend to trade in No. 81 jerseys for a player in good standing. Hernandez’s defense team highlighted his time with “our hometown team” in the opening, and the Patriots made cameos throughout the trial, their logo featured on Hernandez’s pool table or his fiancée’s bank checks. “Aaron Hernandez may have been a well-known New England Patriots football player,” Quinn said. “However, in the end, the jury found that he was just a man who committed a brutal murder.”\n\nRed flags were raised about Hernandez, but the Patriots pushed past them in making a personnel decision to select him in the draft. Kraft maintained after the murder that the entire organization was “duped” by Hernandez. Even in the Super Bowl run, though, there were reminders that everyone involved must be more vigilant. Team chaplain Jack Easterly handed out sheets of paper to interested players, and many could be seen in the locker stalls at the stadium before the team left for the Super Bowl. There was an iceberg in the photograph followed by words:\n\nThe surface that matters most\n\nMichael Fee, a heavyset, curly-haired attorney, waited for Hernandez to take a seat next to him inside Courtroom 9 at the courthouse on July 9. It was just over a year since Hernandez had been arrested. The docket called for a pre-trial hearing.\n\nThe issue before the court was a dispute over personnel files that pitted Hernandez against his former employer, the Patriots. In the second row of the gallery, a woman wore a navy blue jersey with Hernandez’s No. 81 on the front and Randy Moss’ surname on the back. Hernandez, in khakis and sports jacket, entered through a side door, ushered in by three court officers. Once settled at the defendant’s table, Hernandez traded smirks and small talk with Fee.\n\n“You should see the hate mail I get,” Fee said.\n\n“Yeah?” Hernandez said. “You get hate mail? I didn’t know. What does it say?”\n\n“You know, what are you doing representing that guy?” Fee said.\n\nFee sighed; Hernandez smiled. Fee slid a folder into a file in front of him.\n\n“I hope you die, stuff like that,” Fee said.\n\n“For the last year,” Fee said. “That’s the way it goes, baby.”\n\nLawyer and alleged murderer laughed. A microphone picked up each word, a pool camera zooming in to add a visual confirmation, sending the conversation across the Internet to anyone tuned in for the live stream. A court officer announced Justice Raymond P. Veary’s presence, and all parties stood, stiffening in recognition of the jurist. Later alerted to the video leak from a co-counsel’s family member, Hernandez’s defense team filed a protest with the court, calling for a reminder that private conversations were not to be broadcast. During trial sessions, white noise was pumped into speakers over the gallery when attorney sidebars were called.\n\nHernandez’s attorneys kept their antennae up. He enlisted two lawyers in addition to Fee. Sultan and Charles Rankin, name partners at a firm in Boston, huddled with Hernandez, as well, but it was Fee who made the initial trial push. Given the stage, he opened with the argument that jurors would be “flooded with meaningless facts.” He referred to Lloyd as “The Blunt Master,” a nickname assigned to Lloyd by friends for his craftsmanship in wrapping tight marijuana blunts. Fee told jurors that Hernandez and Lloyd partied and chased women together. Fee also attempted to gloss over Hernandez’s contradictions, saying he planned a life as a family man one minute, then acknowledging his propensity to step out another.\n\n“Aaron had a lifestyle. That lifestyle may not be like yours or like mine,” Fee said. “In fact, it may not be a lifestyle that you approve of, but it was a lifestyle not unusual for an unmarried, 23-year-old star professional athlete. In June of 2013, the evidence will show that Aaron liked to go out on the town, he liked to listen to hip-hop music. He liked to drink. He liked to smoke marijuana. He liked to go to nightclubs with his friends. One of those friends was Odin Lloyd.”\n\nRELATED: HERNANDEZ'S FORMER PATS TEAMMATE SHANE VEREEN STILL IN SHOCK\n\nProsecutors chipped away with substantive counters, methodically building a circumstantial case with no murder weapon or clear motive to bolster the first-degree-murder charge. McCauley — tall, trim and steady — proved painstaking in prosecuting Hernandez, calling 132 witnesses and introducing 439 pieces of evidence by the time he rested. He threw everything at the court, including a pre-trial request that Justice E. Susan Garsh recuse herself due to a past clash with McCauley at trial. Garsh stayed on, and the prosecution stitched the evidence together, from surveillance videos to dumpster dives. Jurors rubbed their foreheads.\n\n“We definitely experienced information overload,” said one juror, Anthony Ferry.\n\n“But it was important information,” fellow juror Kelly Dorsey said. “Every bit of it.\n\n“Whatever we got was important information and we used it to make a decision.”\n\nMcCauley’s team used wooden rulers to underline the times text messages streamed in and out of iPhones and Blackberrys. They trained a projector’s lens on exhibits they believed damning, pointing out the former tight end’s loose ends, including a hair-trigger temper seen by some. The government zoomed in on bullets and shell casings, highlighting curvatures and striations, calling a Glock expert in to talk about the weapon investigators never recovered. Jurors were left to decide if Hernandez was the triggerman. Due to Garsh’s evidentiary rulings, the jurors were unaware that Hernandez allegedly committed a double murder a year before Lloyd’s slaying or that he allegedly shot Bradley, a former friend, in the eye. They did not see the take-charge tattoo along Hernandez’s left forearm:\n\nHernandez appeared to relish life as the headliner. For months, he commanded the most attention in the old mill town 50 miles south of Boston. Each afternoon, his attorneys walked past a sign outside the Taphouse Grille across from the courthouse. It offered two specials: the “Guilty Burger” and the “Not Guilty Wrap.” Hernandez’s lawyers ate elsewhere, but Jenkins, in court by herself most days, went in occasionally. She was left alone, for the most part, but Hernandez’s attorneys paid close attention to her throughout. On the morning after Jenkins was granted immunity, Sultan, walking in his harried way, approached her when he shuffled into court.\n\n“You have trouble getting out of your driveway today?” he said.\n\nJenkins was the belle of the trial as she held the most unique position. Her sister, Shaneah, was dating Lloyd at the time of the murder. Her daughter, Avielle, was featured in home surveillance videos from the days before and after the murder, allowed to crawl from Wallace to Hernandez’s hands after Lloyd’s shooting. That video system, once put in to protect Jenkins’ young family, wound up being used as the lone eyewitness in the case, the private lens into the couple’s activities. To hammer home the fact that Hernandez was remorseless after the murder, McCauley allowed footage of Hernandez lounging around the pool to play uninterrupted.\n\nAll eyes were trained on the couple’s interactions during the trial. Day in, day out, Hernandez strode from a holding cell into court, dipping his left shoulder and strutting as if ready to walk out the door free. He scanned the room each time, mouthing sweet nothings to Jenkins, one time purring, “I love you, girrrrrrrrllllllllll!”\n\nRELATED: HERNANDEZ'S FALL FROM NFL STARDOM WITH PATRIOTS ENDS IN A JAIL CELL\n\nShe blushed. When the defense rested, he enjoyed one last moment of levity while his lawyers reviewed evidence with prosecutors. He watched the jurors file out of the room as they readied to deliberate down the hall, and quickly turned his chair around. He eyed Jenkins, dressed in a striped dress and pearl earrings. He inquired about a tattoo on her right arm, and how their daughter, getting over pneumonia, was doing. Cleared by a court officer, Jenkins leaned against the wooden bar to draw closer to Hernandez. Another court officer positioned his chair to their side as Hernandez asked whether his mother, Terri, had already departed court for the day. He rolled his eyes, and Jenkins noted she was gone. Hernandez smiled widely.\n\n“I’m going to change my last name to Jenkins,” he said.\n\nShe smiled then, but she wanted out of the courtroom forever. After the forewoman announced that Hernandez was guilty in the first degree, he craned his neck to find his fiancée. She was crying on his mother’s shoulder. He looked a second, third and fourth time. He pursed his lips and shook his head at the jurors, saying, “You’re wrong.” He then attempted again to make eye contact with his fiancée and mother. In between his attorneys and court officers, he leaned back and looked at them, but the women sobbed in each other’s arms. His mother finally saw him. She consoled Jenkins in her right arm and waved for her son with her left hand.\n\n“Come back,” his mother said.\n\nThe women left a few minutes later, hustled into an elevator and escorted by eight court officers to their vehicles outside. No supporters sat in court for his sentencing, just Hernandez and his attorneys, the men he paid to be there.\n\nFrank Fort, a former Patriots season-ticket holder, watched the lawyers leave as he was walking his poodle and drinking coffee on the sidewalk. He wore a Red Sox World Series hat and a T-shirt emblazoned with Hernandez’s face. The words “Chillin’ Like A Villain” ran across Fort’s chest. He shrugged at the verdict.\n\n“Eh,” he said. “I expected it.”\n\nWooden stakes with yellow caution tape wrapped around them offered a warning to visitors making their way down the pebbled path that leads to Lloyd’s final resting place in the Serenity Garden section of Oak Lawn Cemetery in Boston Wednesday. Rocks were crushed as land was cleared for more burials.\n\nA plastic football stood against Lloyd’s granite headstone, and the No. 53 he wore while a member of the Boston Bandits, a semi-pro football team, was etched beneath his surname. Lloyd’s image greeted all comers from a photo in the center. He wore a Sox hat and flashed a peace sign. He was buried in all white — from Kangol hat to gloves. The casket’s inner lining was stitched with “Going Home” next to a dove flying skyward.\n\n“I have to go to his gravesite to look at his tombstone to tell him that I love him,” his sister, Olivia Thibou, said.\n\nShe was driving en route to court when the verdict came in. She screamed and cried in her car when she heard Hernandez was “guilty.” Her sister, Shaquilla, called immediately, telling her, “I love you!” Shaneah, the eulogist at her brother’s funeral, then made it to court in time to offer an impact statement before the sentencing. She told about Lloyd’s pride, the sandals with holes in them that he wore, the 10 miles he biked to work each day. Later, in front of the courthouse, she noted that she lost a brother but gained a sister in the process, turning toward Shaneah Jenkins and pulling her to the front. Olivia smiled at Shaneah’s shyness.\n\n“I love her because she loved Odin,” Olivia said. “I know Odin loved her.”\n\nOlivia and Shaneah, now a law student, vacationed together in the months since Lloyd was killed, but the family made the cemetery a destination on judgment day. Many paid respects. The sun faded as a strong wind picked up. The assembled masses wore purple — Lloyd’s favorite color — on shirts and in braids. They scribbled personal messages to him on balloons and released them, letting go of the strings.\n\n“I can finally say my son is resting in peace,” Ward said. “We got justice.”\n\nMOBILE USER?

NBC News is reporting that Apple will begin offering the perk to employees in January under its fertility benefit. Facebook began offering the coverage in early 2014 as part of its surrogacy benefit.\n\nThe two tech giants appear to be the first major companies to do so for non-medical reasons. In a sign of its rarity, neither the Society of Human Resources Management nor the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit that does research on workplace issues, have ever asked about egg freezing as a benefit in surveys.\n\nWhile the perk might seem like just another weapon in what's been called the perks arms race of Silicon Valley, it could also resonate in particular with millennial employees who are getting married and having children later than ever before. And of course, it could have an outsized effect on the trajectory of women's careers.\n\nAdvocates of the increasingly popular practice say it gives women more choice and control, allowing them to potentially put off parenthood until it's the right time for them or their careers. NBC News reports a surge in interest since the \"experimental\" label on egg freezing was lifted two years ago. And Bloomberg Businessweek devoted an entire cover story to the issue in April called \"Free Your Eggs, Free Your Career.\" The article cites an NYU doctor who says the procedure has gone from five percent of his clinic's practice five years ago — when it was mostly for medical reasons among, for example, cancer patients — to a third of it now, with most being non-medical.\n\nYet some experts on gender and work-life issues also see potential conflicts for companies that pay for egg freezing. Joan C. Williams, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, calls it a laudable benefit as long as it's offered in the right context. \"If women are asking for it, I think it makes sense to give it to them,\" she says. \"But it shouldn't be a substitute for creating a workplace where motherhood is compatible with a high-powered career.\"\n\nFacebook, for its part, subsidizes day care and gives moms and dads four months of paid leave. And Apple noted in a statement that it continues to expand its benefits for women and wants \"to empower women at Apple to do the best work of their lives as they care for loved ones and raise their families.\"\n\nStill, the move could be a high risk if the coverage is offered somewhere that doesn't offer other family-friendly benefits. Or, it could send the wrong signal in a culture that already only rewards people who commit to putting work above all else, says Anne Weisberg, a senior vice president at the Families and Work Institute. \"If those are the signals, people will read a policy like this not as 'we want to give people more options,' but as 'this is what we expect.'\"\n\nThe news made Weisberg think of how much hasn't changed since she graduated from Harvard Law School in 1985. At the time, the female law partners she spoke with had all waited until they were partners to have children, only to discover it actually wasn't any easier to wait. \"It was harder physically and harder professionally,\" they told her.\n\nBut at too many companies, Weisberg says, putting off children is still considered the way to go. \"Most organizations are still clinging to that male lifecycle model where, if you can’t have the pedal to the metal in your mid-30s to mid-40s, you’re out of the game.\"\n\nWhy I don't breastfeed, if you must know\n\nWells Fargo employee asked the CEO for a raise, and cc'ed 200,000 co-workers\n\nPaternity leave isn't just about dads\n\nLike On Leadership?

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00004-of-00064--1136", "original_text": "By Ilyce R. Glink and Samuel J. Tamkin October 22 at 5:30 AM\n\nWe received a lengthy comment regarding one of our recent columns relating to leasing restrictions in condominiums. We’ve abbreviated the letter as follows:\n\nRental restrictions really can decrease resale values and hurt individual owners who think they might never have to rent until they find out they do. After all, life is unpredictable. And no one should have to beg condo boards for hardship waivers. Too many boards have and promote misinformation about how the percentage of rentals can affect mortgage financing.\n\nTherefore, you would do a service by clearing up the widespread and oft-quoted misperceptions about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines regarding rental restrictions for mortgage financing.\n\nToo many news articles state that FNMA and Freddie Mac have “rental restrictions” of 51 percent. In fact, neither Fannie Mae nor Freddie Mac has any “rental restrictions.” The only restriction they have for established condos is an “owner-occupancy” ratio that applies to investor loans. There are no — repeat, no — “owner-occupancy” ratios required for people buying condos to live in as a primary or even as a secondary residence.\n\nFHA has a 51 percent owner-occupancy ratio, but for many luxury condos, conventional FNMA or Freddie Mac financing is used much more than FHA financing.\n\nThe USA was built on the basis of individual property rights. But condo and homeowners’ associations have become private, feudal governments that are often neither transparent nor subject to meaningful checks or balances. It’s getting worse and worse, especially since it’s hard to find any new housing that is not a condo or HOA.\n\nIn the meantime, individual owners should be allowed to use their units as allowed within the real federal and state laws. No one else should be allowed to restrict lawful use including the ability to rent. There are much better ways of dealing with bad renters and bad owners than by a priori discriminating and restricting such. Better management; notifying and making sure owners take responsibility; requiring provisions in leases that protect the condo common areas and behaviors; helping owners rent to responsible people in the first place by providing a tool kit including how to do due diligence; incorporating renters into the community — all of these will help improve the quality of those who live in the complexes!\n\nYou raise a couple of interesting issues. We even agree with some of them, but we don’t agree with your general contention that people in condominiums or other associations should be bound by no rules other than state and federal laws.\n\nCondominiums are a legal creation to allow the division of parcels of land into either vertical or horizontal condominium associations. By their own definition, specific laws were drafted to allow condominiums to exist. In condominium buildings, an individual owns the air space within a specific unit, but the building as a whole is owned by all of the unit owners. That means that everybody owns a part of the whole. And when everybody owns part of the whole, you have a committee that needs to decide issues dealing with the whole.\n\nYou have to have this kind of system to decide how to make repairs and handle issues that affect all homeowners. Some issues affect them more than others. If a condominium building needs major, urgent repairs, that will affect all of the owners and take priority over other issues.\n\nHow does leasing a unit come into play? There are valid reasons for regulating leasing of units. Some of those regulations may be the same as making sure owners in buildings follow the rules. You certainly don’t want an extended family of 20 living in a 1,000 square foot condominium unit, whether its owner-occupied or rented.\n\nSo the real issue is making reasonable rules and not overdoing it. We know there are plenty of condominium boards and homeowner associations that make rules for everything. In some cases these rules are necessary, as many homeowners live not by the spirit of the association but rather by the strict interpretation of its rules.\n\nHaving said all that, you are wrong in your interpretation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines for their loans. If you have a rented unit in an association, that rental unit is considered an investor-owned unit.\n\nFreddie Mac’s project review will require an established condominium development to have a certain number of owner-occupied units in order to allow buyers to borrow up to a certain amount. While a condominium development may allow a greater number of rental units, the borrower buying in that development may not get as high a loan as he or she would have wanted. Given the buyer’s propensity to finance 80 to 95 percent of the sales price of their properties, the number of rental units in the building does become an issue.\n\nKeep in mind that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac set the ultimate guidelines, but individual lenders may have stricter requirements. The lender furnishing the loan may have more stringent guidelines requiring a significantly higher owner-occupancy level.\n\nFederal Housing Administration (FHA) rules currently require that at least 50 percent of the units in a condominium project be owner-occupied. If the requirement is not met, the borrower may not get an FHA loan.\n\nThe FHA has the most stringent guideline among the big players in the real estate market, and many condominium associations will adhere to the one that allows borrowers to get loans from all of them.\n\nSo it’s valid for condominium and other association developments to mandate some level of owner occupancy. However, some developments have limited the leasing of units entirely. Whether you’d want to live in such an association is entirely up to you. Given the tone of your letter, it seems as though you would be best off owning your own single-family home, where you’d have a fair amount of distance — and autonomy — from your neighbors.\n\nIlyce R.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00003-of-00064--164", "original_text": "WHEN Elaine and Merlin Toffel, a retired couple in their 70s, needed help with their investments, they went to their local U.S. Bank branch. The tellers knew them by their first names. They were comfortable there.\n\nSo when a teller suggested that they meet with the bank’s investment brokers, the Toffels made an appointment. After discussions and an evaluation, the bank sold them variable annuities, in which they invested more than $650,000. The annuities promised to generate lifetime income payments.\n\n“We wanted to make the most amount of interest we could so if we needed it to live on, we could use it,” said Ms. Toffel, 74, of Lindenhurst, Ill.\n\nWhat she says they didn’t fully understand was that the variable annuities came with a hefty annual charge: about 4 percent of the amount invested. That’s more than $26,000, annually — enough to buy a new Honda sedan every year. What’s more, if they needed to tap the money right away, there would be a 7 percent surrender charge, or more than $45,000.\n\nMichael Walsh, a spokesman for U.S. Bank, said that the investments were appropriate for the Toffels, that fees were disclosed and that the sale was completed after months of consultations. But the Toffels now question whether they were given financial advice that was truly in their best interests. Like many consumers, they say they didn’t realize that their broker wasn’t required to follow the most stringent requirement for financial professionals, known as the fiduciary standard. It amounts to this: providing advice that is always 100 percent in the consumer’s interest.\n\nMany people think that they are getting that kind of advice when they are not, said Arthur Laby, a professor at the Rutgers School of Law and a former assistant general counsel at the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Brokerage customers are, in a certain sense, deceived,” he said. “If brokers continue to call themselves advisers and advertise advisory services, customers believe they are receiving objective advice that is in their best interest. In many cases, however, they are not.”\n\nBrokers, like those at the Toffels’ bank, are technically known as registered representatives. They are required only to recommend “suitable” investments based on an investor’s personal situation — their age, investment goals, time horizon and appetite for risk, among other things. “Suitable” may sound like an adequate standard, but there’s a hitch: It can mean that a broker isn’t required to put a customer’s interests before his own.\n\nThere are some specific situations when brokers must act as fiduciaries — for example, when they collect a percentage of total assets to manage an investment account, or when they are given full control of an investor’s account. But under current rules, a broker can take off his fiduciary hat and recommend merely “suitable” investments for the same customer’s other buckets of money. Confusing? Absolutely.\n\n“While many brokers do right by their clients, others push bad products at high prices,” said Knut A. Rostad, the regulatory and compliance officer at Rembert Pendleton Jackson, an investment adviser, and a longtime champion of requiring a uniform fiduciary standard for brokers. “They do so because their culture celebrates sales. They do so because they can.”\n\nIT’S a bewildering situation for consumers, particularly as they try to figure out which advisers do follow a fiduciary standard: Investment advisers, who generally must register with the S.E.C. or a state securities regulator, must put their customers’ interests first, regardless of what accounts they are working with.\n\nThis creates a muddle for investors. Say you sit down with a broker — one who isn’t legally required to act as a fiduciary — and the broker has access to a dozen mutual funds, all of which are deemed “suitable” for a particular customer. The broker can recommend the most expensive fund, even if it makes him more money at the consumer’s expense and isn’t preferable in any other way, Professor Laby said.\n\nOn the other hand, if advisers are following a fiduciary standard, the proper course is clear: “They have to recommend the one that is the lowest cost” because that will be in a consumer’s best interest, he added.\n\nRegulators have been considering whether stronger rules are needed. The Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law of 2010 gave the S.E.C. the authority to propose a rule that would require brokers to act as fiduciaries — but the law didn’t actually require the S.E.C. to enact new regulations. The agency hasn’t yet decided whether it will move forward. Two Republican commissioners have publicly questioned whether it is necessary.\n\nThe Labor Department expects to issue a new proposal in January for a rule that would broaden fiduciary requirements for retirement accounts. In 2010, the department withdrew an earlier proposal after fierce opposition from the financial services industry.\n\nInvestors can’t simply accept an adviser’s title at face value. For example, certified financial planners, a professional designation with some of the more rigorous curriculum and experience requirements, pledge to put their customers’ interests ahead of their own when providing advice — and can lose their designation if they don’t. But even they do not have to act as fiduciaries if they are just selling an investment without including any advice, said Craig W. Lemoine, a program director at the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa.\n\nTo make matters worse, many brokers call themselves “advisers,” a term that suggests consumers can unequivocally trust their counsel much as they might trust the family physician’s. Merrill Lynch, for instance, recently introduced an approach called Merrill Lynch Clear — which is essentially a way for the company to set up a conversation with customers about their longer-term goals and priorities, including family or health issues or whether they need long-term care insurance. Merrill advertises this approach on its website as a conversation with a “trusted adviser,” though not all of its “advisers” are legally bound by a fiduciary duty. Matt Card, a Merrill Lynch spokesman, says the firm’s focus on customers’ broad goals is designed to put a client’s interests first, regardless of whether its representatives are acting as fiduciaries.\n\nEven if stronger protections are enacted, some advisers at financial firms may face potential conflicts of interest, depending on issues like sales goals or incentives that encourage them to push financial products that aren’t ideal for customers.\n\nA former senior account executive at Fidelity, who left last year to join a small independent firm, said he was given sales targets that helped to determine whether he would receive bonuses or retain his job. (He spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he needed to protect colleagues who were still at the company.)\n\n“By far, the biggest two weightings were on your ability to sell annuities and portfolio advisory services,” he said, referring to a program in which Fidelity investment accounts are managed for a fee. “So if you hit all the other goals but missed one of these two, there was a good risk that you could be put on verbal or written warning and quite possibly terminated.”\n\nJoseph Madden, a Fidelity spokesman, said representatives’ compensation is based on whether their advice was appropriate for the customer, as well as other factors related to sales, service and customer satisfaction.\n\nAdvisers’ pay can provide clues about whether their interests may be mismatched with consumers’.\n\nAt the largest brokerage firms — Merrill, Wells Fargo, UBS and Morgan Stanley — there are incentives to bring in new money. These firms typically pay their brokers and advisers 45 to 55 percent of fees and commissions generated for their companies, explained Alois Pirker, research director of wealth management at the Aite Group, which tracks and advises the financial services industry.\n\n“They are very much hunters,” he said. “They are hunting for assets.”\n\nSome brokers may collect a higher percentage of the money they generate for the firm once they hit certain thresholds. That may reward hard workers, as outlined in a 2013 report from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the brokerage industry’s private self-regulator. But it could also encourage an increase in the number or a shift in the types of recommendations that brokers make to customers.\n\nConflicts can also arise when a brokerage firm receives money from, say, a mutual fund provider through a practice known as revenue sharing: Those funds may land on a “preferred list,” which a broker may favor.\n\nIt may be less confusing for consumers to simply pay for advice through “fee-only” independent financial planners who are fiduciaries. Independent planners typically charged from 0.85 percent to 1.15 percent of assets at the end of 2013, according to Cerulli Associates, though fees can vary depending on how much you have to invest. (There is always the additional cost of the underlying investments, though they can be quite low.) Often, in addition to investment advice, those fees cover issues like how much to save or how much term life insurance to buy.\n\nOther advisers charge a single flat fee or hourly fees. The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors and the Garrett Planning Network are groups of fee-only planners, while a network of advisers, called the XY Planning Network, charges subscription fees, typically around $100 a month.\n\nIF consumers really want to put prospective advisers to the test, they could try a direct approach: Ask them to sign an oath stating they will act as fiduciaries, like the one recently created by the Committee for the Fiduciary Standard, an advocacy group. Andrew Stoltmann, a securities lawyer in Chicago, said such an oath would be binding in an arbitration proceeding, which is how a vast majority of customer disputes are settled. “If the adviser refused to sign it, then the investor should run for the hills,” he said.\n\nA fiduciary pledge doesn’t protect an investor from outright chicanery, however. Consider the case of the former Seattle investment adviser Mark Spangler, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison for defrauding customers and money laundering. He previously served as a chairman of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, a group whose advisers pledge to act as fiduciaries.\n\nBarbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, said a fiduciary standard might protect people from brokers who are acting legally but who aren’t recommending the best options for them. “Evidence overwhelmingly suggests that investors suffer real financial harm — albeit unquantifiable harm — as a result of so-called ‘advice’ to invest in products that have high costs, that expose them to unnecessary risks or that simply offer mediocre performance relative to other options,” Ms. Roper said.\n\nThe Toffels, who bought their investments through their bank’s brokerage unit, now wish they had taken much more care in choosing their advisers. “We thought they could help us invest our money smartly and soundly and that just hasn’t happened,” Ms. Toffel said.\n\nWhen the couple initially went to the bank for investment help, they had a portfolio of low-cost Vanguard funds, with an allocation in the stock market that was probably too high, according to the Toffels’ son-in-law, Christopher Lombardo. But following the bank’s advice, instead of merely adjusting that portfolio, they sold it and paid taxes on the capital gains. They put most of their money in the annuities, which were invested in mutual funds and paid 5 percent each year.\n\nBut the illiquidity of the annuities caused serious problems last year, Ms. Toffel said.\n\nWhile the couple followed the bank’s suggestion and held more than $200,000 in money market funds, they found that they were short of cash because their life situation had changed: Mr. Toffel, 78, received a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s and needed to move into a skilled nursing facility, while Ms. Toffel wanted to buy an apartment in the same senior community. But much of their money was locked inside those very costly annuities, which carried the 7 percent surrender charge.\n\n“I was sick about it,” said Tammy Lombardo, the couple’s daughter.\n\nHer husband, Mr. Lombardo, has spent many hours documenting their predicament and petitioning the bank for a hardship withdrawal, which has been successful.\n\nThey ultimately received some of the money from the annuities without paying the surrender charge, but they are still trying to undo other changes made by the bank to their financial arrangements.\n\n“It’s been a mountain of red tape and hoops to jump through,” Mr. Lombardo said.\n\nRequired to make “suitable” recommendations to investors based on criteria like age, goals, time horizon and risk appetite. Generally not required to put customers’ interest first at all times, a standard called fiduciary duty.\n\nBackground Check: For information on a specific broker, try the BrokerCheck website, at finra.org/Investors/ToolsCalculators/BrokerCheck/. It covers brokers and firms registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, Wall Street’s self-regulator. But Finra’s system has been criticized because some brokers have had complaints expunged from their records.\n\nRequired to put customers’ interests ahead of their own — that is, they are required to act as fiduciaries. Advisers and their firms generally register with the Securities and Exchange Commission or a state securities regulator.\n\nBackground Check: For information on specific advisers, try the Investment Adviser Public Disclosure website, reachable at adviserinfo.sec.gov. It scans S.E.C. data, as well as BrokerCheck and state securities regulators’ sites.\n\nBecause some people giving financial advice are dually registered as brokers and investment advisers, ask them which hat they are wearing — and whether they are acting as fiduciaries. Then get it in writing.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on October 12, 2014, on page BU13 of the New York edition with the headline: Before the Advice, Check Out the Adviser.

And I'd be remiss if I didn't touch on the greatest Anthem I've ever heard at a game -- the late Whitney Houston's, 21 years ago. I'll get to other things around the NFL, too, but I still find so many things fascinating about the rise of Eli Manning, and the rise of this cornerstone franchise with him.\n\nWe'll start in the stands at a football game in the small city of Oxford, Miss., a little more than nine years ago.\n\nScene 1: Nov. 2, 2002, Oxford, Miss. The general manager of the New York Giants, Ernie Accorsi, is sitting outside, in the row of seats in front of the Mississippi press box, scouting the quarterback of Ole Miss, Eli Manning, against heavily favored Auburn. It's bitterly cold. Taking notes that afternoon for his scouting report (which six years later would be an important element of Tom Callahan's insightful book, The GM, on Accorsi's last year with the Giants), Accorsi is watching two future first-round picks at quarterback -- Manning and Auburn's Jason Campbell -- and seems riveted by Manning.\n\nA couple of days later, Accorsi types his report in all capital letters to be submitted as part of the team's scouting report on Manning. In a section of the report covering the second half, he writes: \"NEVER GETS RATTLED. RALLIED HIS TEAM FROM A 14-3 HALFTIME DEFICIT BASICALLY ALL BY HIMSELF. LED THEM ON TWO SUCCESSIVE THIRD QUARTER DRIVES TO GO AHEAD, 17-16. THE FIRST TOUCHDOWN, ON A 40-YARD STREAK DOWN THE LEFT SIDELINE, HE DROPPED THE BALL OVER THE RECEIVER'S RIGHT SHOULDER. CALLED THE NEXT TOUCHDOWN PASS HIMSELF, CHECKING OFF TO A 12-YARD SLANT. MAKES A LOT OF DECISIONS ON PLAY CALLS AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.''\n\nScene 2: Dec. 12, 2004, Baltimore. The one thing Eli Manning always has had is poise. That's what makes this horror show at the Ravens so weird, and so troubling.\n\nWhen quarterbacks go to the line of scrimmage, they most often point to the foe they're using as the middle linebacker, in order for the offensive line to know which man they're going to block. The first man to the right of the \"mike'' linebacker, for instance, will be blocked by the right guard, etc. And so when Manning would see Ray Lewis, number 52 on the Ravens, across the line and bark out, \"52's the mike,'' Lewis would scurry to the outside of the formation and yell, \"I'm the mike!'' And Ed Reed or another defender would slip into Lewis' spot and yell, \"I'm the mike!'' They were taunting Manning, and it shook him up.\n\nSays Manning now: \"A nightmare. A disaster. They saw me sweating it, and they took advantage of me, to say the least.''\n\nIn the fourth start of his Giants' career, Manning was the definition of pathetic, four of 18 for 27 yards, with no touchdowns and two interceptions ... for a 0.0 passer rating. In the press box, one veteran Giants scribe took to calling Eli \"Billy Ripken'' over and over again. As in, \"The brother of a great player who'll just never make it.''\n\nScene 3: Feb. 5, 2012, Indianapolis. Manning was down by 11 that cold day in Oxford. He was down eight here in Super Bowl XLVI. But he led the Giants to two field goals in the third quarter, and when he took over at the New York 12 with 3:46 to go, the Accorsi scouting report comes to life. On the first snap (ON A 40-YARD STREAK DOWN THE LEFT SIDELINE, HE DROPPED THE BALL OVER THE RECEIVER'S RIGHT SHOULDER), Manning, on a 38-yard streak by Mario Manningham down the left sideline, dropped the ball over the receiver's right shoulder, and Manningham made a perfect catch and got both feet down and the Giants were in business at midfield. The Patriots were stunned.\n\nFour plays later, on second-and-eight from the Patriots' 32, offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride thinks the Pats may blitz. He gives Manning a running play to use if they don't, and tells him to check to a quick slant if they do blitz. \"Alert, alert!'' Manning says, walking up and down the line when he sees safety Patrick Chung and linebacker Brandon Spikes getting ready to blitz. The run is off. The pass is on. (Remember Auburn-Ole Miss, and Accorsi. CHECKING OFF TO A 12-YARD SLANT.)\n\nManning takes the shotgun snap. Three Patriot blitzers are erased by Kareem McKenzie, Ahmad Bradshaw and Kevin Boothe. Textbook blitz pickup orchestrated by veteran line coach Pat Flaherty and running backs coach Jerald Ingram; both men came to the Giants with Coughlin in 2004. Hakeem Nicks runs a quick slant inside cornerback Antwaan Molden, and Manning throws a strike. Gain of 14.\n\nThe other day I asked Gilbride to pick the plays on that drive he thought were the crucial ones. He picked two. \"The one to Manningham, of course,'' he said, \"and a quick slant to Nicks. We were not settling for the field goal. No way. Not unless we had to. We were attacking.''\n\nTwo vital passes against Auburn, a streak down the left side and, on a Manning audible, a quick slant: Gain of 52.\n\nTwo vital passes against the Patriots, a streak down the left side and, on a Manning audible, a quick slant: Gain of 52.\n\nAccorsi, who lives in Manhattan, watched the game in the solitude of his home in his hometown of Hershey, Pa. \"On that last drive,'' Accorsi said, \"I said, 'He's gonna do it.' I've seen it before.''\n\nEli Manning needed to sleep. After three days of revelry, parades, ring-sizing and backslapping, he'd had enough. \"We've got to get out of here,'' he told his wife, Abby, and so they left their Hoboken, N.J., nest Thursday and went somewhere. Where, I don't know. But he was good enough to call me Friday and explain two things: how he survived 2004, and how he won the fourth quarter in last week's Super Bowl.\n\nRemember what happened in 2004. The Giants could have stayed where they were on draft day, at number four in the first round, and taken Miami of Ohio's Ben Roethlisberger. But Accorsi traded a bushel full of picks to San Diego to get Manning.\n\nIn training camp, Kurt Warner won the starting job. He got off to a 5-2 start, but then lost to Chicago and Arizona, and first-year Giants coach Tom Coughlin went to Accorsi and said he wanted to make a change at quarterback. He wanted Manning to play. He knew Manning was the future, and even though Warner likely would have given them a better chance to beat the defensively strong upcoming foes, Coughlin thought he was going to Manning at some point, and he knew the kid's confidence wouldn't get strafed if he played. That's what Coughlin thought, anyway. \"I do recall how desperately Eli wanted to be in there,'' Gilbride said last week. \"He was dying to play.''\n\n\"I redshirted my freshman year at Ole Miss,'' Manning told me, \"and when I was put in there, I was ready to play. My rookie year here, at first, it was an opportunity to watch an MVP play. Kurt was great to me. I would ask him tips about picking up the blitz. And when coach Coughlin went to me, I knew it hurt Kurt. I felt for him. But he was still a professional, helping me. He could have been a lot of things, but I can tell you he was a help to me.''\n\nWarner likes Manning, and vice versa. This was a tough situation, because Warner thought the Giants were throwing away the season -- maybe to justify the trade and the selection of Manning. And Warner looked right for the first month. Manning put up only 23 points in losses to Atlanta, Philly and Washington, and then there was the 37-14 debacle at Baltimore, the day Warner had to come in to rescue Manning in relief. \"He was overwhelmed by the situation,'' Warner told me on my podcast last week. \"It was some of the worst quarterbacking I'd seen at the NFL level.''\n\nThe Ravens, Gilbride said, \"did everything they could to humiliate Eli.''\n\nManning didn't fold. He had a huge week coming up, and a short week. The Giants took the train back to New Jersey after the Sunday game in Baltimore. Coming the following Saturday: a nationally televised game against Pittsburgh, at home, with Roethlisberger, who looked like a big star in the making for the Steelers, coming to the Meadowlands to show everyone in football that Accorsi and the Giants made a big mistake in picking Manning and not him.\n\nOn the two-hour ride to Newark, Manning spoke with Gilbride and then-offensive coordinator John Hufnagel. Rather than sulk about the disastrous game he'd played, he told them his eight favorite plays. He told them, \"If you could put these in the game plan next week, it'd give me eight plays I'd be comfortable with -- rhythm plays, plays I know I'd have an open receiver even if it was just a short gain.''\n\nNotable that Manning could think about the next game 90 minutes after the most embarrassing game of his life. \"I was down, really down,'' he said. \"But I knew if we could put some plays in the plan for the next week that I liked, I'd feel better about it -- and the offense would see in practice we'd be able to move the ball.''\n\nThat week, he met with Coughlin. \"I'm better than this coach,'' Manning told him. And Coughlin said he knew that, and don't look over your shoulder; just play. But around the team, this was a big week, and a tense week. Roethlisberger and the Steelers were 12-1. In the New York Daily News, Gary Myers wrote, \"So far, it's shocking how inept Manning has looked. The field looks 200 yards long.'' Accorsi told Myers that week: \"I don't want to talk about Roethlisberger. This thing will be written over a long time, not, in Eli's case, four weeks.\"\n\nNow, Manning says: \"I didn't read the paper in high school, and I never got the paper in college. I could kind of tell what was being said about me by the questions the reporters would ask. So I didn't read about me. Same thing when I got to the Giants. But I could tell that week was a big week. The media was like a bunch of hungry dogs. They were coming for me. And I hadn't played well, so that's the way it goes.''\n\nStrange game. Willie Ponder of the Giants returned the opening kick 91 yards for a touchdown. Roethlisberger threw a pick on his first drive. The Steelers scored on an Antwaan Randle El shovel pass. Manning followed with a 55-yard touchdown drive ending in a two-yard touchdown pass to Jeremy Shockey. The crowd was getting into it.\n\nBack and forth they went, the Giants taking a 24-23 lead at the end of the third quarter on Manning's second touchdown pass of the day, the Steelers coming back to take the lead on a Jeff Reed field goal, Manning driving the Giants 52 yards for another TD (a Tiki Barber TD run) to put the Giants up 30-26 midway through the fourth quarter, and Jerome Bettis burrowing behind right tackle with five minutes left to make it 33-30, Steelers.\n\nDriving to tie or win it, Manning threw a pick at the Steelers 18 with three minutes to play. Ballgame. \"You don't like to say losing a game was a big mental boost for us,'' Manning said, \"but it was. That was the day I thought I showed our team I could play at a high level.''\n\nManning that day: 16-of-23 (.696), 182 yards, two TDs, one interception, 103.9 rating.\n\nRoethlisberger: 18-of-28 (.643), 316, one TD, two interceptions, 84.8 rating.\n\nThat's the day Manning took the heat off himself. He's never really felt it since.\n\nNow to the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl last week. Much has been said and written about the fateful final drive, and the throw to Manningham in particular, when Nicks and Victor Cruz were lined up to the right and Manningham to the left.\n\nThe Giants took over at their 12 with 3:46 to go. Gilbride wanted to take a shot on first down.\n\n\"I thought 'Rio' [Mario Manningham] could run by the one corner on the left,'' Gilbride said. \"I didn't know if Eli would choose that side, but I thought the play might be there. The thing is, I knew Eli wouldn't make a bad decision there. He's rooted solidly in this offense, and he has a strong belief what's there and what isn't there.''\n\nIn a story about this play for Sports Illustrated this week, I wrote that Manningham had gone to Gilbride on Thursday and was blunt about the Giants' playcaller not forgetting him -- or the receivers as a group -- in the game against the Patriots. \"We feel we can win this game,'' Manningham said. \"You have to understand --we're not nervous. We're excited. The stage is definitely not too big for us.''\n\nOn Friday, Manning told me Manningham came to him, too. There wasn't much three-wide stuff in the game plan, Manningham said, so when he's in there, he was going to get open and take advantage of his opportunities. The strong inference: Don't forget me. I'm going to help us win.\n\nDuring the week, Manning had written notes in his game plan about this play. He wrote about how the New England safeties don't get very wide when they're taking a half of the field apiece. Manning thought, watching tape of the Patriots, \"There'll be opportunities to make plays downfield on them.'' But still he didn't think this play was a lock to go right, as he had --according to backup quarterback David Carr -- every time he'd ever seen this play run in practice or a game.\n\nWhen the ball was snapped, Manning was still thinking Cruz or Nicks first, and that made Chung, the safety who would have responsibility over the top on Manningham, creep over to his left, to provide help if Manning went to that side. \"I wasn't looking [Chung] off,'' Manning told me. \"I was truly throwing to the right. But the cornerback looked like he was in good position on Victor. I thought the nickel was too close to Hakeem. I didn't like what I saw.''\n\nIn his split-second look to the left, Manning saw Manningham with a step or step-and-a-half on corner Sterling Moore, with Chung, hips open to the left and inside the numbers, with very far to turn and run to break up the play if Manning threw left to Manningham.\n\n\"It's one of those plays,' Manning said, \"where I can't throw it inside, toward the field, or the safety could knock it away. And I can't underthrow it. Those are the two no-nos. If I throw it too far, nothing's lost. It's second down, and we'll be OK.''\n\nThe throw traveled 42 yards in the air. As it dropped into Manningham's hands at the Giant 47, Moore's right forearm clubbed Manningham's right shoulder, trying to dislodge the ball; Chung arrived a split-second later and mugged Manningham over the boundary into the Patriots' bench area. Every Patriot but Bill Belichick signaled the play was no good because Manningham surely was out of bounds. But he wasn't. Manningham got both feet in the field of play before the mugging.\n\nLater, Gilbride asked Manning why he'd made that decision. \"The other guys got jammed,'' Manning told him. \"And I threw it where no one else could get it.''\n\nEli Manning might play 10 more years and never make a throw better than that one. Sheer perfection ... and thrown to a receiver determined to make a big play in the biggest game of his life.\n\nThe audible to the slant to Nicks \"was easy,'' Manning said. \"I could see the two safeties crowding the line, so it was the only call to make.''\n\nAfter the completion to Nicks gave the Giants first-and-10 at the two-minute warning at the Patriot 18, Manning looked across the line. \"We hit 'em in the mouth,'' he said. \"I think they were getting worried then.''\n\nFunny thing about the touchdown, the six-yard score by Ahmad Bradshaw three plays later. Manning thought to tell Bradshaw not to score when he got to the line. However, Gilbride and Coughlin never thought to tell the Giants to beware of the Patriots handing them the touchdown.\n\nManning saw the Pats being a little lax when he got to the line, and when the snap came, he saw a defensive lineman stand up -- as though he wasn't going to try to make a tackle or rush the passer. So when Manning handed the ball to Bradshaw, he said, \"Don't score!'' But Bradshaw couldn't process it in time, and by the time he got to the two-yard line and tried to stop, his momentum carried him into the end zone.\n\nTwo takeaways: The fact that Gilbride and Manning have been together for eight years is a huge factor in Gilbride knowing what Manning will execute well in a certain situation. \"He completes my sentences,'' Gilbride said. And Manning told me this about Gilbride: \"He is what I know about NFL offenses. I can't tell you how huge an advantage it is to be with the same coordinator for so long.''\n\nAnd Manning's approach to football is a factor in him being so good, late, in such big games. He's been down to the Patriots in the final two minutes the last three times he's played them. And he's driven the Giants 83, 80 and 88 yards in those three games, scoring each time in the final minute to win. How does a person not allow the moment to overwhelm him? Or at least to affect his play? Manning looks like he'd rather play in the fourth quarter, with 116 million people watching.\n\n\"I think it comes from the fact I can only do so much,'' Manning said. \"And I want to give our team every chance to win, and I want to give myself every chance to compete and to win. I control half the game, and even then I can't control one of our guys fumbling. So I have always had the attitude that if I do everything in my power to prepare, and then I have confidence that we've got a good plan and I know it's good enough to win, then I just go play and whatever happens happens.\n\n\"If we lose, will I be mad or upset? Yes. For a few days. But I think after some time, a few days, I'm not going to let it ruin my life for the next two months. I've got a wife and a daughter, and it's not fair to them to ruin the offseason because we lost a football game. I need to be there for them.''\n\nOne last thing from that Accorsi scouting report. Something about guts. Manning may not look the part, but someone who plays the way he does late in games has something that Accorsi saw that day in Mississippi, something he'd also seen in his Colts days with Johnny Unitas, something Colts teammate Bobby Boyd saw too. Wrote Accorsi: \"BOYD TOLD ME ONCE ABOUT UNITAS, 'TWO THINGS SET HIM APART: HIS LEFT TESTICLE AND HIS RIGHT TESTICLE.' ''\n\nLots of lessons here. A good organization, with a strong GM, should be trusted above all. Young, Accorsi and Reese have served the Giants extraordinarily well in the last 33 years. Good coaching, with a staff that mostly stays in place, is most often the hallmark of a winning organization. And a good quarterback, with guts, well, that doesn't hurt either.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nEli Manning's poise and toughness were evident in his days at Ole Miss and again in Super Bowl XLVI.

The former secretary of state, who has been distancing herself from Obama, took an unmistakable jab at the current president in answer to a question about diminishing American clout in the world: “We have not been telling our story very well. We do have a great story.” Clinton said, “We are not perfect by any means, but we have a great story about human freedom, human rights, human opportunity, and let’s get back to telling it to ourselves first and foremost and believing it about ourselves and then taking that around the world. That’s what we should be standing for.” That’s a nearly identical criticism as leveled by many of Obama’s version of the national narrative.

Adding to the intrigue, Christie’s staff suddenly removed the video from YouTube overnight after receiving negative comments. The governor’s press office has not responded to questions about why the clip was taken down. “No Pain, No Gain” was reposted to YouTube this morning by a third-party poster named ‘kmop.’” [New in Fox Opinion: Gov.

(Gallup shows a similar number.) That’s far short of the number of newly insured that the CBO projected in April of this year, in February of this year, or in 2012 — and it’s less than half the tally the American people were told Obamacare would hit when they opposed it in 2010.” PERCEPTIONS TRUMP REALITY FOR GAY POLITICAL CLOUT An extensive Centers for Disease Control study reports that 1.6 percent of American adults self-identify as gay or lesbian, a departure from previous estimates that placed the number closer to 4 percent. It’s certainly a far cry from the public perception that 25 percent of Americans fall into that group. The political consequences of the gap between perception and reality are significant, helping drive (and in turn being driven by) the political and cultural focus on issues like same-sex marriage and the status of gay military members. To understand the clout of a group that the CDC estimate says includes fewer than 4 million American adults, consider the lack of political juice of other, larger demographic groups. The Pew Research Center reports that nearly 7 percent of Americans are members of historically black Christian denominations, a group four times larger than the gay community in the new government study. But members of historically black churches have repeatedly been turned back or marginalized in their political efforts in recent years, including on the subject of same-sex marriage or their pleas for President Obama to take more urgent action on growing black poverty and violence in cities like Chicago. Money matters, too. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... They’re the wurst. That’s what the German government said about dozens of top-dog sausage sellers this week, imposing a fine equal to $460 million for price fixing, The Atlantic reports. Regulators say the large fine reflects “the duration of the cartel and the billions in sales earned in the market.” (Not to mention how seriously Germans take their sausage.) But, there’s an economic lesson here, as well. Germany’s cartel system is running mom and pops out of business at a furious rate. As the FT reports on government efforts to punish monopolistic sausage ambitions: “Yet the number of craft butchers has been falling steadily as family-owned businesses find it difficult to attract workers, and discount supermarkets such as Lidl and Edeka take their toll. At the end of 2012 there were 14,372 butcher shops across the country, according to the German Butchers’ Association – down from nearly 16,000 in 2010.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

The DCCC brought in $10.9 million in donations and has $50.9 million in its bank. The NRCC raised $9.6 million and has $42.5 million on hand. PINGPONG BALL SIZED HAIL… NO WAIT, JUST PINGPONG BALLS AP: “A pilot who dropped 3,000 pingpong balls that were redeemable for prizes missed a crowd assembled for the stunt and instead hit a nearby interstate. Organizers immediately called off the contest. Aaron Moon and helpers on Saturday told revelers at Blackfoot [Idaho] Pride Days not to risk retrieving the pingpong balls amid high-speed traffic because organizers still planned to pass out the prizes. Most of the pingpong balls could have been exchanged for candy, but some were worth gift certificates up to $100. Moon says a new pilot attempted the drop this year, but apparently didn't understand that pingpong balls lose speed quickly and drop straight down.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “The president has to have [the immigration crisis] stopped, because it contributes to this story shown in all the other elements abroad and at home that his administration is incompetent, out of control and unable to control anything. … And that’s why he will acquiesce to the change in the law.” –Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00007-of-00064--710", "original_text": "Somewhere along the line, somebody signed us up for the Barack Obama campaign emails. Normally we don't care for spam, political or otherwise, but these are so odd that we've kept them coming out of curiosity. Some of them have a stalker-like quality, plaintive yet vaguely menacing in their persistence, such as the one we noted in September titled \"James, can we meet for dinner?\"\n\nIf you don't like it, you can always unsubscribe. But now the campaign is turning the creepiness up a notch. The Obama re-election effort has \"asked supporters to make a campaign donation 'inspired' by somebody else,\" reports Joel Gehrke of the Washington Examiner.\n\nThis one doesn't seem to be going to everybody on the list; we have yet to receive it--though our latest missive from BarackObama.com is somewhat similar in concept: \"Have you been thinking about who you'd bring to the next Dinner with Barack?\" it asks. \"Tell us who you would bring if you won--and why.\" But the campaign isn't going to contact your plus-one; the Web form asks only for the name.\n\nBy contrast, the form for the \"inspire\" solicitation asks for an email address for your donation muse so that the campaign can \"send them [sic] a message letting them know they inspired you to donate.\" The Obama campaign is deliberately sending spam to people who never signed up for it. You can also give a donation \"in memory of\" someone, and the site still asks for an email address. You can take the politician out of Chicago, but you can't take Chicago out of the politician.\n\nIt gets worse. Blogress \"Bookworm\" reports having received this variant of the \"inspired\" email:\n\nSure enough, BarackObama.com has a special Web form for donors who wish to have \"fun at the expense of a Republican.\" Let's say you're a Republican and your 20-something daughter is an Obamabot. (Have you had a DNA test?) She makes a $10 donation to the president's campaign, which sends her an email tweaking you--and your name and email address are now on a list of dissenters against the most powerful man in the world.\n\nProbably this is just what the campaign presents it to be--a juvenile prank that is harmless beyond the nuisance of receiving campaign spam. Then again, remember AttackWatch.com? The Obama campaign has a history of clumsy appeals with vaguely totalitarian overtones.\n\nHe Must've Underestimated How Bad It Was\n\nWho's the Least Reliable Conservative? \"Mitt Romney blasted Republican presidential rival Newt Gingrich on Tuesday as an 'extremely unreliable leader in the conservative world' who has taken positions in the campaign that should give GOP voters pause as they consider their choices for the party's nomination,\" the Washington Post reports:\n\nThe Puffington Host's Sam Stein adds that Gingrich, in one of his many books, praised Andy Stern, then head of the Service Employees International Union, as 'the union leader who probably best understands the challenge of the world market and the need to make American union members productive in the face of world competition.\" Stern, a strong supporter of President Obama, was last seen in The Wall Street Journal, singing the praises of Chinese communism.\n\nRomney, however, acknowledges in the Post interview \"that he has not always been in step with conservatives and said that he was 'wrong' not to sign Gingrich's 1994 Contract with America when he was running for a Senate seat in Massachusetts.\" The Boston Globe has some background on the 17-year-old clash between the two men, during which Romney assured Massachusetts voters: \"I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush.''\n\nNow he is trying to convince Republican voters that he is trying (more or less) to return to Reagan Bush. The Washington Post's Ezra Klein, the young left-liberal blogger who founded Journolist, has an unusually insightful post arguing that Gingrich is likely to win this argument. He cites some history from Romney's successful 2002 race for governor of Massachusetts:\n\nAs Klein sums it up: \"Whatever Gingrich's heterodoxies, conservatives never worry that he's not, on some fundamental level, a committed member of their tribe.\" This is a subtle distinction: Both Romney and Gingrich are vulnerable to the charge of being inconstant or unprincipled. But whereas neither man has been entirely consistent on what he stands for, Romney has flip-flopped on what he is.\n\nThe Witching Hour \"Republican political figure and tea-party favorite Christine O'Donnell says she's backing Mitt Romney's presidential bid,\" the Associated Press reports:\n\nIt may be that that ad wasn't true. After all, if O'Donnell isn't a witch, who turned Romney's chief opponent into a Newt?\n\nRunning From Obamaville \"A planned meeting today between the Congressional Progressive Caucus and Occupy Wall Street activists was scuttled late Tuesday after Roll Call inquired about it, highlighting increasing tensions between Democrats and the movement,\" Roll Call reports. The idea of being seen in daylight with the denizens of Obamavilles sent even the hardest-left members of Congress scurrying:\n\nBut to judge by their actions rather than their words, it looks as though avoiding the Obamavillians is more important than \"embracing the issues and the struggle.\"\n\nThomas Friedman's Imaginary Undergrads How bad a writer is the Worst Writer in the English Language? Don't get us started. Oh wait, we're already started. Today he tries to explain the world to a foreign leader:\n\nFriedman goes on to list four other things that supposedly confuse Wisconsin students, all of which have to do with Israel's domestic politics. Does he provide any evidence that the confused Badgers actually exist? No, he does not. True to his word, this is just Friedman's \"guess\" as to what undergrads in Madison think.\n\nOur guess is that very few Wisconsin students are sufficiently aware of these goings-on within Israel to either have an opinion or be confused about them. The New York Times is actually paying Friedman to advise a foreign leader on the views of imaginary American undergraduates.\n\nTwo Fashion Critics in One!\n\nHomer Nods The resolution to propose a constitutional amendment abolishing most limits on government power has seven co-sponsors in the House.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00004-of-00064--1003", "original_text": "HBO’s “Game of Thrones” has become just as popular as sports during it’s run. Fans pick sides and cheer on their favorite characters as passionately as they would for their football team of choice.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, “Game of Thrones” and the sports world aren’t that different. Both feature heartbreak, betrayals, wins, losses and the occasional jaw-dropping moment. Here are sports franchises and/or figures that could represent the powerful families in “Game of Thrones.”\n\nThis ‘Game of Thrones’ parody job site rules\n\nVery much like the Brooklyn Dodgers, House Baratheon essentially no longer exists. The American Baseball team famous for signing Jackie Robinson in 1947 dropped off the baseball map a decade or so later while members of House Baratheon on the other hand, were wiped out with the deaths of Stannis and the remainder of his family in \"Game of Thrones'\" fifth season.\n\nBoth the legacies of the Brooklyn Dodgers and their Baratheon counterparts however, will continue on - just under different names. The late king Robert fathered a slew of bastards - enough to start his own baseball team - but because they're illegitimate, they don't bare the Baratheon name. Similarly, the Brooklyn Dodgers will continue to live on through the Los Angeles Dodgers' franchise.\n\nTennis Superstar Serena Williams has changed the game of tennis and Daenerys Targaryen has changed the game of thrones, so it only makes sense the Mother of Dragons, who is the sole surviving member of her house, shares a series of similarities with fellow solo act and female powerhouse Williams.\n\n‘GoT’ fans uncover the cryptic synopses for last two episodes\n\nThe Grand-Slam-winning, record-breaking athlete has spent her nearly 20 years in the game breaking down both gender and race barriers in the sport that made her famous, and the Last Targaryen, like the tennis superstar, has risen above gender norms that suggest her leadership would be less effective than her male counterparts. They've both also had to overcome older siblings (Serena used her skills while Dany chose violence) to claim their top spots.\n\nAdditionally, Williams has been dubbed by many as the best female athlete of all time while the majority of \"Thrones\" fans have singled out the Khaleesi as the best option to rule the seven kingdoms.\n\nHouse Tyrell of Highgarden is one of the Great Houses of Westeros just like the New York Yankees are historically among baseball's best. But the similarities don't end there.\n\nBoth the Tyrells and the New York franchise are known for their deep pockets - the Highgarden family is the richest in Westeros thanks to their prime location, and the popular baseball team can boast the very same.\n\nUnfortunately for both the Tyrells and the Yankees, it seems their time on top could be coming to an end. The Yankees, who haven't won a World Series since 2009, are currently hanging out in fourth place while Margaery Tyrell, her brother Loras and the rest of the house have been fighting a losing battle with the Faith Militant.\n\nBut \"Thrones\" fans - not unlike baseball fans - would never be naïve enough to count out the wealthiest of players, no matter their standing or their given status.\n\nBill Murray says Cubs winning World Series: 'This is the year'\n\nThe homes of both the Freys and the 49ers boast two of the more iconic bridges in recent history. Named one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Golden Gate Bridge is among the things most closely associated with the San Francisco football team's bay area home.\n\nHouse Frey, located in the Riverlands is known for its control of The Crossing, a bridge which connects two twin castles. It lies directly on the main route from Winterfell to Riverrun and will forever live in \"Thrones\" infamy as the Stark negotiations for passage culminated in the Red Wedding Massacre, which led to the death of key Stark players and a never-ending hate for House Frey.\n\nAnd not unlike the Freys, the San Francisco 49ers aren't without their haters - we're looking at you Seahawks fans.\n\nIn football, most people root for two teams: their own and whoever is playing the New England Patriots. The same is true for \"Game of Thrones\" fans - it doesn't matter whether they're Team Stark, Team Lannister or Team Targaryen, no matter what happens, they'll be rooting against the vicious House Bolton, a family so violent it's known for flaying its enemies.\n\nA look at what the 'GoT' leading ladies are really up to\n\nRamsay Bolton may have taken Winterfell and dubbed himself King of the North, but he clawed his way to the top by way of treachery, terror and betrayal. The New England football team, while its players (in a significantly less violent way) have proven ruthless on the field, has also been accused of earning their top-dog status through tactics that are less than above-board: the Patriots in 2015 became the center of one of football's biggest scandals, popularly referred to as Deflategate.\n\nThe Lannisters were once one of the most powerful families on \"Game of Thrones,\" but their fortunes have slowly treaded downhill on the show. Cersei and Jaime believe they're family is still on top of the mountain, but in reality that's not the case. Jaime and Cersei have seen their brother Tyrion murder their father while two of their three children have been killed off. Meanwhile, their last son Tommen is in a power struggle in King's Landing with the High Sparrow. The two have since been served dishes of humble pie, while their brother looks for redemption in Meereen alongside Daenerys.\n\nJust like the Lannisters, the Dallas Cowboys were once a franchise that was on top of the sports world. However, the team hasn't won a championship in over 20 years, nor have they even appeared in a Super Bowl. The last glimmer of hope for the Cowboys lies in the hands of quarterback Tony Romo and the legacy of the Lannister could be upheld by Tyrion, a fan-favorite on the series.\n\nHeartbroken fans of the Chicago Cubs would get along great with fans of the Starks. The Chicago Cubs have been leaving their fans in emotional pain since 1908, which was the last time the team captured a World Series. Not only has it been 108 years since they last took home a championship, but they haven't even appeared in a World Series since 1945. The team has been cursed with gut-wrenching losses and collapses throughout the years, despite being a winning franchise early in its history.\n\n'Game of Thrones' tough guy has a warning for Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nLike the Cubs, the Starks were once a prominent family in Westeros until horrible things started happening the. Ned was executed for trying to put the proper king in charge of the seven kingdoms, Catelyn Stark and Robb were killed at a wedding, while Jon Snow, Bran, Arya, and Sansa have all had their own share of traumatic situations through the show's six seasons. However, the Cubs are on the rise as are the Starks. It could be a matter of time before both are back on top of their respective kingdoms.\n\n\"We will not sow\" are the words the Greyjoys live their lives and the same can be said about the Buffalo Bills. The Greyjoys have been a part of every major war throughout the years on \"Game of Thrones.\" However, they always come out on the losing side of things. They may get to the big game, but glory rarely goes their way. The Buffalo Bills made it to four straight Super Bowls in the 90's and were one of the best teams of the decade. However, they lost all four Super Bowls and have no rings to show for their appearances.\n\nThe Greyjoys are currently in a state of civil war as some are following Yara and Theon to find Daenerys, while the rest of the iron born are following the new king Aeron Greyjoy. Yara and Theon could take back their home of Pyke and actually be on the winning side of a war for once. Buffalo will have to hope that Rex Ryan reunion with his broth Rob, could get them back into the playoffs in 2016.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and House Tully are similar for more reasons other than they're both near bodies of water. House Tully had control of Riverrun for thousands of years, just as the Los Angeles Lakers dominated the NBA for decades. Now that's drastically changed.\n\nFollow the Daily News Sports on Facebook. \"Like\" us here.\n\nJust as Edmure Tully surrendered his castle back to the Lannisters and the Freys, Kobe Bryant basically surrendered the state of California over to the Golden State Warriors. The Lakers once reigned supreme, but just like the Blackfish was the last great Tully, Bryant is currently the last great Laker, at least for the moment. The Blackfish went down fighting before being defeated, while Bryant tried his best to carry the Lakers over the past few years. Both ended up failing, leaving the future uncertain for both House Tully and the Lakers.\n\nSometimes sports can provide people with a shocking loss, just as the HBO drama can. The Martells were wiped out in a brutal fashion on \"Game of Thrones,\" just as Baltimore lost the Colts in a stunning manner. After Oberyn Martell had his head popped like a water balloon in a trial by combat on the show, his brother Prince Doran Martell and his only heir, Prince Trystane were also brutally murdered by Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes. The Martell's are now officially extinct on the show, even though Oberyn's daughters are still alive.\n\nThe Baltimore Colts were moved out of the city to Indianapolis overnight in March 1984. Baltimore was left without an NFL franchise, after residents had supported the NFL team for 30 years. The NFL didn't return to Baltimore until 1996 when the Cleveland Browns were moved there and became the Ravens. Although the Baltimore Colts do still technically exist in Indianapolis, the franchise is extinct in Maryland, just like the Martells are legally gone from Dorne.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nHBO’s “Game of Thrones” has become just as popular as sports during it’s run.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00013-of-00064--350", "original_text": "Today the world remembers Michael Jackson.\n\nHundreds and maybe thousands will gather in Gary, Ind., the Jackson family hometown, to witness the unveiling of a statue to honor the pop icon; his mother Katherine is expected to attend. In Los Angeles fans will gather at Forest Lawn Memorial Park where the King of Pop is entombed. And in Detroit, where it all started, Motown announces today the opening of an exhibit, which will feature photographs from concert performances, television appearances, international tours and the TV cartoon series featuring the Jackson 5.\n\nMotown Museum curator Lina Stephens was online Friday, June 25, at Noon ET to talk about the early days of the Jackson 5, the emergence of Michael Jackson as a solo artist and stories of of their lives on the road and on the charts.\n\nLina Stephens: Hello, I'm Lina Stephens, Chief Curator of the Motown Museum.\n\nBethesda, Md.: How was Michael offstage..during the Motown years..his demeanor\n\nLina Stephens: He was a shy, child, he enjoyed playing with his brothers.\n\nLos Angeles, Calif.: What would be your thoughts about either moving or having a second museum honoring Michael Jackson in Los Angeles? I ask this because it would be more accessible to more fans than would Gary, and Michael also had strong roots to southern California.\n\nLina Stephens: I have heard that there is to be a Jackson 5 museum in their hometown of Gary, Indiana. However, I do think that Michael is a big enough talent to support a museum anywhere.\n\nFairfax, Va.: Back in the day were the Jackson 5 enamored of the big Motown stars before they themselves became stars? What did the old guard at Motown think of the new young guys?\n\nLina Stephens: They thought that they were talented kids. It was also the beginning of a new era for Motown since the company had moved to LA. Therefore, they were handled in a different manner than the older artists.\n\nWashington, D.C.: What will the Motown Museum be doing special today to commemorate the one-year anniversary of Michael's death?\n\nLina Stephens: We have local television and radio stations doing live interviews; we have a Michael Jackson impersonator performing; and, we have the Jackson 5 exhibit in the Museum. We also have Michael Jackson items in the gift shop.\n\nAnnapolis, Md.: Did Michael and his brothers ever come back for a visit to Motown in Detroit?\n\nLina Stephens: Michael has been to the Museum several times. However, we have no record of his brothers visiting.\n\nOrlando, Fla.: What's your fondest memory of Michael?\n\nLina Stephens: Michael Jackson had a way of capturing his audience with a flair that can not be justly described. It is clear that he was a very old soul.\n\nWashington, D.C.: What was the reaction at Motown and in Detroit when Michael Jackson had died?\n\nLina Stephens: Pure and utter shock. We got the news by 5:20 p.m. (EST) and by 5:30 p.m., his fans had started to leave tributes in his honor on the steps of the Museum.\n\nWashington, D.C.: I just have a comment about Michael Jackson. To me he was a man who loved people and just was not accepted for what he was. He was kind and gentle and in this world that should be the norm but it's considered weird. He was one of if not the best entertainer of all time. His fans seem to see him in a better light than others who made fun of him and made his life a living hell. I don't think we will see anyone of his talent for years to come.\n\nAnnandale, Va.: Who discovered the Jackson 5? Diana Ross, Gladys Knight? Suzanne de Passe?\n\nLina Stephens: Actually, it was Bobby Taylor of the Vancouvers. Then, Gladys Knight had witnessed the Jackson 5 during a performance at the Apollo Theater in New York.\n\nWhat the?: Am guessing I was born/raised between the two \"icons\" of music -- Elvis and MJ -- and so do not quite \"get\" their importance. Given this is a MJ chat, what was his definitive contribution to music/culture?\n\nLina Stephens: Michael Jackson achieved a 'first' in a lot of musical milestones: He was the youngest performer to have a #1 hit song and four consecutive #1 hit songs; his album, \"Thriller\" is still the best-selling LP of all time; he has had awards created in his name and likeness to award other performers; he was the first African-American artist to have his music videos played on MTV. He also changed the scope of how music videos are traditionally made in that, they were like movie productions that each told a story. His messages of peace and love in his songs and in his philanthropy were not fake. Therefore, millions of people could identify with him and embraced his philosophy as, it did not attack anyone's religious, political or moral views, but it just had a universal appeal. This is what I think makes Michael a phenomenon and why he has so many people, globally, that absolutely adored him.\n\nPerryville, Md.: Where the Jackson 5 \"good boys\" or were they misbehaved? I've heard stories that MJ was mischievous.\n\nLina Stephens: Yes, all of the Jackson 5 members were good boys. And, yes, Michael liked to play practical jokes, but I think that was to keep things lighthearted on the road.\n\nWest Palm, Fla: Michael was obviously an profoundly talented child, a prodigy of sorts, but did you have any idea he would become an entertainment icon?\n\nLina Stephens: No, I don't think anyone had an idea that Michael would become all that he did. However, in his musical evolution, his iconic status seemed almost inevitable.\n\nWashington, D.C.: What happens at Motown now? Is any recording ever done there anymore? Or is it basically a museum?\n\nLina Stephens: Motown is a Museum.\n\nHollywood, Calif.: Do you remember where you were when MJ died? I do! There is a CNN/HLN host, Jane Velez -- who has covered MJ from the beginning. She should have some fantastic guests on her show \"Issues\" tonight. Apparently Michael's father has finally filed a lawsuit -- and I think he could win. So sad....\n\nLina Stephens: Yes. I had just left work and I had received a call from a local reporter with a confirmation of Michael's passing. That info was the last thing I expected to hear. Hopefully, the events that have occurred after his passing will come to a quick and just resolution and not blemish the memory of Michael.\n\nBaltimore, Md.: Did you have any indication back then that Michael Jackson might turn into the person he did and that his end would be tragic?\n\nLina Stephens: Again, I'm not sure that anyone could have predicted the person that Michael would have become. It is very sad that his life would be cut so short. But, as we've seen in history, some of the brightest stars seem to leave us way too soon.\n\nChicago, Ill.: Will anybody move into their home?\n\nLina Stephens: If you are referring to the home in which Michael died, there is someone already occupying it. I believe it is Christian Audigier, the designer of the Ed Hardy line. Neverland Ranch? Not anytime soon.\n\nWashington, D.C. : What other Motown stars have come back to visit their old digs? I realize many are dying off and I'm saddened by that.\n\nLina Stephens: Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, Joe Billingslea (of the Contours), Duke Fakir (last living original member of The Four Tops), Otis Williams (last living original member of The Temptations), just to name a few! They all come back home. :)\n\nWashington, D.C.: When the group recorded for Motown there was a special production team that produced their records which included hand-picked staff producers by Berry Gordy and Gordy himself. Why did he do this?\n\nLina Stephens: The reason is that the hit songwriting of Holland-Dozier-Holland was gone, therefore, Mr. Gordy created The Corporation to create hit songs for the J5.\n\nIndia: Dear Prince, Paris and Blanket We're With You\n\nWhen you miss mj, we're with you in spirit, wondering how you feel, hoping you're coping, and getting a little better each day. We understand. We care. When you're grieving, we're beside you, in our hearts, in our thoughts, we're sending you sympathy, encouragement, affection, and strength to carry on with life. mj would want it that way. we all love you mansi arora\n\nLina Stephens: Michael would appreciate your concern for his children.\n\nLina Stephens: I'm sure Murray will not pay what we all think that he needs to pay. But, he will have to live with what he has done.\n\nJacksonville, Fla.: In the bustle of people coming forward saying all kinds of things what would you like the world to know about Michael that it may not already know?\n\nLina Stephens: I think, basically, we know all we need.

(WhiteHouse.gov)\n\nPresident Obama was at Northwestern University on Thursday to deliver an economic speech that, he and his team hoped, would lay out the case for why the public is better off today than they were six years ago -- even if they didn't feel it in their everday lives. Instead, Obama just gave every Republican ad-maker in the country more fodder for negative ads linking Democratic candidates to him.\n\nHere are the four sentences that will draw all of the attention (they come more than two thirds of the way through the speech): \"I am not on the ballot this fall. Michelle’s pretty happy about that. But make no mistake: these policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them.\" Boil those four sentences down even further and here's what you are left with: \"Make no mistake: these policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them.\"\n\nYou can imagine Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas or Sen. Kay Hagan in North Carolina or Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky grimacing when they heard those 28 words. That trio has spent much of the campaign insisting that this election is NOT about Barack Obama, that it is instead about a choice between themselves and their opponents.\n\nThe reason for this distancing strategy is obvious: President Obama is deeply unpopular in many of the states that will decide which party controls the majority in 2015. Of the seven seats rated \"toss ups\" by the non-partisan Cook Political Report, Obama lost four of them (Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina) in 2012. He also lost in three Democratic-held open seats -- Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia -- now viewed as sure-thing pickups for Republicans. If Republicans only won Democratic-held seats where Obama lost in 2012, they would pick up 7 seats -- one more than they need to recapture the majority.\n\nIn many of these states, Obama's numbers are in a (much) worse place today than in November 2012. Just four in ten Louisiana voters approve of how President Obama is doing his job in a recent CNN/Opinion Research poll. In Arkansas, Obama's approval rating is at 31 percent, according to an NBC/Marist poll. Even in Colorado, a state Obama won in 2008 and 2012, his approval rating sat at just 39 percent in another NBC/Marist survey.\n\nIt doesn't take a political mastermind to realize that an ad in which the President of the United States says \"Make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them\" might not be helpful to the Democratic candidates trying to run away from him this November.\n\nSo, why did Obama say it? My guess is that he wanted to make the stakes clear to a Democratic base that, by virtually every polling measure I've seen, is less enthusiastic to turn out and vote on Nov. 4 than Republicans. The idea being that if you like Obama and his policies -- which his base, especially African Americans, still do -- then you need to show it by going out and voting. The Obama political team is working under the assumption that if you dislike President Obama, nothing he says or does is going to change that reality. So, why not show the Democratic base that this election is worth fighting for?\n\nI think that underestimates the impact of an unpopular president (on video no less!) bluntly insisting that an election in 33 days is indeed a referendum on his policies. Republicans couldn't have written a better script than that.\n\nChris Cillizza writes “The Fix,” a politics blog for the Washington Post.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00010-of-00064--763", "original_text": "It is common in contemporary opera for a director to update the setting of a story and impose some interpretive concept on a piece. Most directors do not go so far, however, as to reorder scenes, tweak the plot, excise whole ensembles and interpolate musical numbers from a different score.\n\nBut the Russian director Dmitri Tcherniakov essentially does all of this in the Metropolitan Opera’s new production of Borodin’s “Prince Igor,” which opened on Thursday night. Yet his wonderful staging is dreamlike, wrenchingly human and viscerally theatrical. The impressive cast, with many Russian singers, is headed by the compelling bass Ildar Abdrazakov in the title role.\n\nIf Mr. Tcherniakov takes big chances in this revelatory production, strong intervention is called for with “Prince Igor.” Borodin, a research chemist by profession, left the score in shambles when he died suddenly at 53 in 1887, having worked on the piece for 18 years. Rimsky-Korsakov, a respected Russian master, assisted by Glazunov, then a fledgling composer in his early 20s, salvaged Borodin’s original. They completed the orchestration, stitched segments together, fleshed out scenes left in sketches, and more. Their version became a beloved work in the Russian repertory, despite its flaws.\n\nIldar Abdrazakov sings the title role in this scene from a recent dress rehearsal.\n\nAt various times musicologists and conductors have sifted through Borodin’s reams of score pages and fashioned other versions. Still, it is impossible to know what the composer intended. The plot has big holes in it. Every production is a reclamation job.\n\nThe Met’s may be the best of them. Working closely with the conductor Gianandrea Noseda, who led a vibrant and textured performance on Thursday, Mr. Tcherniakov has not so much condensed as concentrated the opera, which still runs for more than four hours (with two intermissions). Using vivid black-and-white silent-film segments created for the production, he brings the audience close to the singers and relates missing portions of the story. The libretto, written by Borodin, is based on an anonymous 12th-century epic poem.\n\nActually, the basic plot is straightforward: Igor, an ancient Russian prince in the city of Putivl, gathers his army for a campaign against the nomadic Polovtsians, who have been ravaging the Russian territories. Igor’s troops are defeated, and he and Vladimir, his son, are taken captive.\n\nVladimir falls in love with the sensual daughter of Khan Konchak, the ruler of the Polovtsians, who sees in his captive a potential ally, if only Igor will seek a truce. Vowing to continue the fight, Igor escapes. He returns to a city in ruins and feels like a failure. Still, his people hail his return.\n\nIn this production, Mr. Tcherniakov emphasizes Igor’s self-doubting nature and insecurity. The opera is presented as Igor’s internal search for clarity, including dreamscape episodes in which he ponders what has happened.\n\nMr. Tcherniakov, as is his practice, designed the sets. The prologue, in Putivl, takes place in a simple public meeting room with yellow-beige walls, a ceiling of wood beams and dangling electric lights. The people are gathered to send the soldiers, dressed in russet-colored uniforms (the costumes are by Elena Zaitseva), off to battle. It looks to be the early 20th century, though the settings convey timeless immediacy.\n\nFamilies and friends mostly sing from the balcony that surrounds the room. But Mr. Abdrazakov’s Igor, looking panicky, paces among the troops, sometimes adjusting their hats.\n\nSolid and ruggedly handsome, Mr. Abdrazakov is a confident actor. Though his voice is firm and robust, he is not one of those formidable, gravelly Russian basses. He is a fine singer of Italian repertory, and his Igor has moments of Italianate lyrical refinement. He brings passion, even a touch of neediness, to his exchanges with his devoted wife, Yaroslavna, the Ukrainian soprano Oksana Dyka in her Met debut. She is like a classic Russian soprano, with a cool, penetrating intensity, fearless high notes and a glint of steel in her sound.\n\nIn this production, the prologue is followed by Borodin’s scene in the Polovtsian steppes, here called Act I. (Some versions place it as Act II.) The defeat of Igor’s troops is something we only learn about after it has happened offstage. Mr. Tcherniakov includes a filmed episode after the prologue showing close-ups of worried soldiers, flashes from explosions and, finally, the twisted corpses of fallen troops. These images overlap with the beginning of the haunting music of the Polovtsian scene, set in a wondrous, almost surreal field of red poppies, a captivating way to depict the lure of the East.\n\nThe act is presented as if it is all taking place in Igor’s mind, but he encounters very real people. The charismatic Georgian mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili brings her plush big voice and a sultry physicality to the role of Konchakovna, the daughter of the Khan (the muscular Slovakian bass Stefan Kocan). Konchakovna, deep in thought and yearning for Vladimir, sings a great aria wondering when her beloved will come to her. The Russian tenor Sergey Semishkur, in his Met debut, is an earnest, impetuous Vladimir, singing with a slightly nasal and impassioned voice.\n\nThe trade-off for turning this act into a dreamscape is the confusion Mr. Tcherniakov introduces for people new to “Prince Igor,” which is seldom heard in America. The work was last presented at the Met in 1917, if you don’t include a few performances in 1998 by the visiting Mariinsky Theater in a very traditional, very bland production.\n\nWhen Mr. Abdrazakov sings the captive Igor’s great aria of lament for having brought his army to defeat and his country to shame, at one point he addresses his wife, knowing that she alone would forgive him. In this staging, the wife, Ms. Dyka, appears as if in a vision to Igor. Some people in the audience might become confused over just who is real and who is a phantom in this scene.\n\nThe best-known music from “Prince Igor” is the popular Polovtsian dances with chorus. To stage the music, Mr. Tcherniakov turns his poppy field into a lush pasture where some three dozen dancers (bare-chested men and women in light spring dresses) cavort to choreography by Itzik Galili. The Met choristers sing from the side boxes closest to the stage. Acoustically the effect is thrilling. By the end of the scene, even Igor seems momentarily enthralled by the sensory splendor all around him.\n\nIgor has entrusted his wife and his city to the care of his brother-in-law, Prince Galitsky, a coarse cad, who schemes to take power while Igor is captive. The feisty Russian bass Mikhail Petrenko is a sneering, prickly Galitsky, exhorting his followers into frenzied drunken revels that jibe with the pummeling rhythms of the music.\n\nFor all its theatricality, this production focuses your attention on Borodin’s beguiling score. Even during anthems, dances and elegies, Borodin tapped into depths of sadness that seem part of the Russian culture and heritage. Mr. Noseda conveys the Russian character of the music, while conducting it with clarity and precision. The Met chorus is at its glorious best.\n\nMr. Tcherniakov and Mr. Noseda take the biggest leap at the end of the opera. The libretto describes Igor as returning to a city in ruins. Here the decimated public meeting room, which has been hit by bombs lobbed by the Polovtsian troops, shows the grim extent of the ruination. The shellshocked Igor is barely recognizable. Mr. Abdrazakov does his most burnished, powerful singing in the prince’s despairing soliloquy in this scene. Then the people hoist Igor, as if oblivious, on their shoulders and sing his praises — the way the opera traditionally ends.\n\nBut Mr. Abdrazakov’s Igor looks stunned to see his people cheering him. Then, “The River Don Floods,” an orchestral scene that Borodin wrote for another dramatic work, is played. During its turbulent opening episode, Igor stomps among his people looking unhinged.\n\nSlowly, as the music turns pensive, he calms down and picks up salvageable items from among the rubble. One by one, the others help him. The people of Putivl are going to regroup. It is not going to be easy. But they begin.\n\n“Prince Igor” runs through March 8 at the Metropolitan Opera; 212-362-6000, metopera.org.\n\n“Prince Igor” runs at the Metropolitan Opera through March 8, 212 362-6000, metopera.org\n\nA version of this review appears in print on February 8, 2014, on page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Blazing Folk Tale Spliced With Grainy Sorrow.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00011-of-00064--378", "original_text": "Sen. John Walsh (D-Mont.) probably isn't returning to Congress in 2015. That was true this morning, and it's even more true now that we know he apparently plagiarized a significant portion of his master's thesis less than a decade ago.\n\nThe New York Times's Jonathan Martin on Wednesday afternoon revealed what appears to be some pretty extensive plagiarism in the senator's thesis at the Army War College in 2007. To wit:\n\nAn examination of the final paper required for Mr. Walsh’s master’s degree from the United States Army War College indicates the senator appropriated at least a quarter of his thesis on American Middle East policy from other authors’ works, with no attribution.\n\nMr. Walsh completed the paper, what the War College calls a “strategy research project,” to earn his degree in 2007, when he was 46. The sources of the material he presents as his own include academic papers, policy journal essays and books that are almost all available online.\n\nMost strikingly, each of the six recommendations Mr. Walsh laid out at the conclusion of his 14-page paper, titled “The Case for Democracy as a Long Term National Strategy,” is taken nearly word-for-word without attribution from a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace document on the same topic.\n\nWalsh hasn't quite admitted to the plagiarism, but his campaign isn't disputing the story and attributes the mistakes, in part, to a difficult time in his life, after someone he served with in Iraq committed suicide.\n\nWhile the story immediately dominated what has been a massive political news vacuum, it's also worth noting that this kind of thing is hardly the career-ender it once was. While politicians in the past, including Vice President Biden, have seen their careers suffer significantly from plagiarism, more recent history suggests academic misconduct isn't anything close to a deal-breaker for the American voter.\n\nThose who appear to have plagiarized in some form in recent years include no less than President Obama (who appeared to borrow some lines from Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick on the 2008 campaign trail), Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, former senator Scott Brown (R-Mass.) and, most recently, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).\n\nAnd it's not just plagiarism. As Nathan Gonzales noted earlier this month, the Senate is packed with politicians with similar foibles on their record -- whether it's plagiarism, lies on their resume or questions about their roles in some unsavory events.\n\nIn 2010, The New York Times pointed out inconsistencies between Democratic state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal’s rhetoric and his military service during the Vietnam era. It became a major issue in the campaign, but Blumenthal prevailed, 55 percent to 43 percent, over former wrestling executive Linda McMahon.\n\nTwo years later, Democratic Rep. Christopher S. Murphy ran for the Nutmeg State’s other Senate seat. In September of the election year, it came to light that the congressman missed multiple mortgage payments and the bank had started the foreclosure process on his home. Murphy defeated McMahon, 55 percent to 43 percent, that November.\n\nThe Connecticut senators are certainly not alone in having facing potentially disastrous headlines during the campaign.\n\nIn 2008, comedian and former radio talk show host Al Franken had to answer questions about his involvement in a never-aired “Saturday Night Live” sketch that involved “60 Minutes” correspondent Lesley Stahl being raped. And he paid $70,000 in back taxes in 17 states during the race. Franken defeated then-Sen. Norm Coleman, R-Minn., with 42 percent and a margin of 312 votes.\n\nIn 2012, Democrat Elizabeth Warren faced multiple days of questions about her family’s Native American heritage and whether she used it inappropriately to get a teaching position at Harvard Law School. She defeated Sen. Scott P Brown, R-Mass., 54 percent to 46 percent.\n\nDemocratic candidates are not the only ones hit some ruts on the campaign trail.\n\nIn 2010, Republican Mark S. Kirk falsely claimed to have received an Intelligence Office of the Year award from the U.S. Navy. The congressman went on to defeat state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, the Democratic nominee, 48 percent to 46 percent.\n\nWe think this point is well-taken, and we all have a tendency to over-estimate the importance of something like plagiarism the moment it happens. Walsh could very well rebound just fine from this.\n\nBut it certainly hurts him. For a few reasons:\n\n1) He was already down. A major difference between the names above and Walsh is that he's already fighting an uphill battle, with polls showing him trailing Rep. Steve Daines (R) by between seven and 18 points. It's one thing to have a story like this come out when you have some margin for error or you're tied. Walsh was already fighting a losing battle.\n\n(We would also note that some of the names above, including Blumenthal and Murphy, won by smaller margins than they probably should have.)\n\n2) Walsh isn't a known quantity. All of the people above have pretty lengthy political careers to speak of, and even Paul has become well-known in the time since he was first elected in 2010. When that's the case, it's easier for people to give you the benefit of the doubt. Walsh, though, is a political newcomer who has never won office in his own right and was thrust into the big-time relatively recently. Are Montana voters going to stand by a guy who they've never really even stood by in the first place?\n\n3) This has to do with credentials. Of all the above, the one that probably hurt the most was Blumenthal's -- mostly because he appeared to inflate his resume and it had to do with military service (in Vietnam). Walsh's misdeed isn't on the same level, but it's still cheating to advance your career. As Martin reports, his master's degree was part of the reason he was named adjutant general of the Montana National Guard in 2008.\n\n4) It fits a pattern. The biggest GOP attack on Walsh before Wednesday was that, in 2010, he was reprimanded for soliciting National Guard troops to join a private association -- the National Guard Association of the United States -- for which he was seeking a leadership post. Such pressuring is a no-no. It's pretty easy to see GOP attack ads combining these two items in his past to make Walsh look like someone who will do whatever it takes to get ahead.\n\nThe four arguments above notwithstanding, we think plagiarism ranks pretty low on the list of things that voters care about. And it certainly helps his credibility that Walsh is no less than a bronze-star recipient -- something his allies were quick to point out Wednesday afternoon in his defense.\n\nreality check: John Walsh was awarded a Bronze Star “for exceptionally meritorious service\" in Iraq\n\n— Matt Canter (@mattcanter) July 23, 2014\n\nBut to the extent that Walsh was already an underdog and that this causes people who don't really know him to question his character, it's a pretty bad day for his campaign.\n\nAaron Blake covers national politics and writes regularly for The Fix, the Post’s top political blog.\n\nSECTION: {section=politics, subsection=null}!!!

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00013-of-00064--970", "original_text": "Jerzy Tomaszewski was lying badly wounded in the rubble of the devastated city of Warsaw. He managed to raise himself on one arm and press the shutter to capture the catastrophic scene around him. It was the last war image he would take. It was September 6 1944, the 37th day of the Warsaw uprising. The city had endured continual bombardment from German forces and there was more to come: in the 63 days of that desperate struggle, more than 250,000 people lost their lives in the biggest, most heroic insurrection the Nazis ever faced.\n\nTomaszewski had used photography to defy the Germans all through the war. In 1940, the eldest of his five brothers - all of whom were members of the Home Army (the Polish underground resistance) - recruited the 16-year-old Jerzy onto a secret training course in photography. He then went to work in Foto-Rys, a photographic shop in central Warsaw that served the German occupying forces.\n\nBy 1940 Poles were no longer allowed to own cameras or take photographs, but there was no lack of custom at Foto-Rys. \"The Germans loved photography,\" says Tomaszewski, now 81 and still living in Warsaw's rebuilt Old Town, site of some of the fiercest fighting. The 20 or so Polish workers were kept busy processing and printing Nazi propaganda photographs and snapshots taken by ordinary German soldiers. They often showed atrocities - round-ups, Jewish ghettos, public hangings and executions. \"When we first saw these pictures it was a shock for everyone,\" says Tomaszewski.\n\nThe underground established a secret cell in Foto-Rys. It was run by a chemical engineer called Andrzej Honowski who instructed Tomaszewski and fellow conspirator Mieczyslaw Kucharski in making illicit copies of the incriminating material. The copies were smuggled to the Polish government in exile, based in London. \"It was highly dangerous work,\" Tomaszewski says, \"but we were young and we didn't always understand the danger, or the importance of the work we were doing.\"\n\nIn fact it proved too dangerous - in 1943 the Nazis got wind of the Foto-Rys operation and raided the shop. Tomaszewski and Kucharski were tipped off and got away, but Honowski wasn't so lucky - he was arrested and executed. Undeterred, Tomaszewski and Kucharski continued their activities, organising a secret laboratory where documents and photographs were copied on to tiny strips of microfilm so that they could be smuggled in pens, razor handles and shoes.\n\nIn January 1944, the nature of the war was changing. The Red Army was on the march, its relentless drive west carrying it across the prewar Polish-Soviet border. By the end of July the Soviets were only 12 kilometres from the centre of Warsaw - close enough to hear the gunfire. By that time the Soviets had set up the pro-communist \"Lublin committee\" and had declared that the Home Army were no better than fascists. Thousands had been interned.\n\nIn Warsaw, the Home Army realised it had little choice but to go on the attack. If they did not, they would be accused by the Soviets of collaboration, and if they waited for the Red Army to march in, the Lublin committee would be established in the capital. The decision to begin the battle was based on the assumption that the allies would airlift vital supplies and the Red Army would support them. The assumption was misguided on both counts.\n\nWhen the uprising began, on August 1 1944, Tomaszewski was one of some two dozen photographers assigned by the Bureau of Information and Propaganda (BIP) to document the battle. Tomaszewski remembers the main principles of his job: always be on the frontline; process the film as soon as possible; and protect the negatives at all costs. The underground commandeered a number of photo labs, including one called Foto-Greger where a photographer named Waclawa printed Tomaszewski's photographs. Each print, captioned and dated, was dispatched to the daily newspapers and bulletins.\n\nAfter five years of brutal occupation, there was jubilation that the fight had begun. \"For the first three days,\" says Tomaszewski, \"it was a wonderful atmosphere.\" The cultural life of this \"secret underground state\" as it was known, flourished. Newspapers and cinema newsreels reported on the uprising; there were concerts, and Polish radio returned to the airwaves. But by August 7, the Germans had begun to mobilise special forces, and a terrifying array of military might. There were round-ups, deportations to concentration camps, and executions: in the space of a week, an estimated 35,000 civilians - men, women and children - were massacred. The insurgents could not compete militarily, but their ingenuity and the support of the civilians helped them to maintain the uprising.\n\nThe human cost was enormous. \"As the daily bombardments increased, the death toll rose, and as food and water supplies ran low the population became ever more desperate,\" says Tomaszewski. \"My duty was to photograph not only the fighting but also the civilians, to find out how they were coping as they were confined to cellars without food or medicine, weapons or ammunition.\n\n\"It was difficult, they were suffering and I was taking photographs and writing about it.\" But he never doubted the importance of his photographic evidence. \"Whenever I was in trouble or covered in rubble, I worried only about the camera and film.\"\n\nHe worked wherever possible, often with his Dolina 35mm camera hidden beneath his coat. \"We had no military training and the work was increasingly dangerous. On one occasion I was told to photograph a German unit that was bombarding the city from the top of a building. I managed to get on top of the building opposite. To test the situation I put my hat on a stick. It was immediately blown to pieces.\"\n\nBy the end of August the Germans had tightened their grip on the central Old Town area. The air raids and artillery attacks increased. Armed mainly with Molotov cocktails, the Home Army fought on, but faced an impossible task. By early September thousands of fighters and civilians began to evacuate through the city's sewers.\n\nWhen Tomaszewski heard that the central power station was under attack, he went to take photographs. \"By then the Germans were in the centre of town with tanks,\" he says. \"They were burning and destroying everything all around me. I was very frightened. There was tragedy everywhere: people carrying injured children, people being buried alive in the cellars. I was scared all the time. Comrades were shouting at me not to risk my life taking photographs.\"\n\nWith the Old Town collapsing around him, Tomaszewski was running across a main street between tanks shelling the buildings when he was caught in a blast of shrapnel and falling rubble. With his legs covered in blood, his comrades dragged him to the ruins of his nearby family home where he collapsed. \"I was desperate to take more photographs,\" he says. There he took that last frame, showing several bodies lying in the street and a woman checking them for signs of life.\n\nTomaszewski's comrades took away his camera and underground ID in case of capture - effectively saving his life - and dragged him to the hospital. \"There were so many other injured people worse than me - many without arms or legs - that I asked to be left outside so that I could be treated later,\" he says. \"This was the worst moment of the uprising for me. As I lay on the ground the hospital was shelled. Everything was in flames and people were jumping from the windows. I was crawling towards them, but I couldn't help. They were burning alive and I couldn't do anything to help them.\"\n\nThe fact was, no one was helping the Poles. Despite endless pleas for assistance, the they were caught between the conflicting interests of the western allies and the Soviet Union and neither considered it in their interest to help. While the Red Army sat silently on the eastern bank of the Vistula, Winston Churchill pledged support, but besides a few air drops, the support was pitiful. When Stalin refused allied planes permission to land on Soviet controlled airbases, making further air drops impossible, neither Churchill nor Roosevelt exerted pressure. In mid-September, when a German victory was imminent, the Russians airlifted a few supplies, but it was too late. By allowing the Home Army to be annihilated, Stalin in effect had the Nazis do his dirty work for him.\n\nOn October 2, the Home Army capitulated. The Germans expelled the surviving population and razed the city. It was another three months before the Soviets rolled into the eerie landscape of deserted ruins.\n\nTomaszewski had been rounded up at the hospital with 20 other people and sent to the Pruszkow detention camp, about 20km outside Warsaw. But he managed to escape and went into hiding in the mountains in the south. In February 1945, he returned to Warsaw to bury his mother and one of his brothers - their bodies had been found beneath the rubble of their home. He took a few photographs among the ruins, balancing on his crutches. After that he took no more photographs. \"The trauma of the uprising left a permanent scar,\" he says.\n\nAfter the war, the insurgents who had survived were effectively silenced. Under the communist regime any mention of the Warsaw uprising was dangerous. Over the next few years an estimated 50,000 members of the Home Army were killed, interned or deported to the Gulag. For almost 10 years the photographic evidence of the uprising was hidden away, along with the memories, but after Stalin's death in 1953 the \"thaw\" began and four years later the first collection of uprising photographs was published\n\nNone of Tomaszewski's photographs featured in the book - as far as he knew, they had all been buried beneath the rubble. But in June 1975 he saw an advertisement in a Warsaw newspaper from someone who was looking for him. He did not know the surname, but it was Waclawa Zacharska, who had printed his photographs during the war. He had not seen or heard from her since 1944, but she had taken all his negatives from the laboratory and hidden them in metal cans. The building had been destroyed, but the cans remained: although some were badly damaged, more than 600 photographs survived. Two years later, in May 1977, they were displayed in the first exhibition of images from the uprising, in Warsaw. In 1979 his book, Episodes in the Warsaw Uprising, was published.\n\nTomaszewski's home in the Old Town now doubles as his archive, and includes the artwork of his eldest brother Stanislaw, the Home Army's chief artist, and hundreds of images from Foto-Rys which had been hidden by his mother. He calls the collection his \"family archive\".\n\nHis apartment is within walking distance of the family home in whose ruins he lay to take his last photograph. He shows me the picture and falls silent. \"Was it all worth it?\" I ask him. \"Perhaps it wasn't,\" he says. \"So many lives were lost. It seems countries where people collaborated had it better than us.\n\n\"But later I heard that the Nazis already had a plan to destroy Warsaw and its population. Either way, the people of Warsaw couldn't have won.\"\n\n· Janina Struk is author of Photographing the Holocaust: Interpretations of the Evidence (IB Tauris)", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nJerzy Tomaszewski was lying badly wounded in the rubble of the devastated city of Warsaw.

Kennedy was in the White House.\n\nInvestors have seen $806 billion erased from the value of American equities since President Barack Obama was re-elected Nov. 6 in the biggest decline since May. The combination of falling stocks and rising profits as the economy recovers has left the S&P 500’s price-earnings ratio below the ending level of eight of the nine bull markets since 1962 and beneath the average of any since Ronald Reagan was in power.\n\nBears say the 4.8 percent drop in the S&P 500 and valuations show investors are losing confidence that Congress and Obama will reach a budget compromise that would keep the recovery from stalling. Bulls, including the top strategists at six Wall Street firms, say that the declines are another reason to buy and that stock prices from Apple Inc. (AAPL) to Dollar Tree (DLTR) Inc. are bound to improve as earnings increase.\n\n“The stock market looks cheap because people are way too pessimistic about what growth looks like for the next 10 years,” said Brian Jacobsen, who helps oversee $208 billion as chief strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds and predicts the S&P 500 will rise 47 percent to 2,000 in 2014. “You can get big and rapid moves in the market when expectations are so low.”\n\nConcern about the so-called fiscal cliff -- $607 billion of spending cuts and tax increases that automatically go into effect Jan. 1 -- overshadowed better-than-estimated profit reports from Cisco Systems Inc. and Home Depot Inc. last week, sending the S&P 500 down 1.5 percent to 1,359.88. Obama began face-to-face talks with top Republicans and Democrats on Nov. 16 after he and House Speaker John Boehner said they will work toward an agreement. Boehner and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney described the meeting as “constructive.”\n\nEven as shares fall, strategists are optimistic about gains next year. The S&P 500 will rally 17 percent to a record 1,585 by the end of 2013, according to the average forecast. The index climbed 1.3 percent to 1,376.96 at 9:36 a.m. New York time today.\n\nDouglas Kass, the founder of Seabreeze Partners Management Inc. in Palm Beach, Florida, who recommended buying stocks at the March 2009 low says the benchmark gauge may rise 18 percent to 1,600 next year as politicians reach a budget compromise and the economy continues to expand.\n\n“The No. 1 mistake that is being made is the old proverb, ‘Once bitten, twice shy’,” Kass said in a Nov. 14 Bloomberg Radio interview with Tom Keene. “Market participants today are incorrectly playing the last war, which took place during the budget deliberations in August of last year. Those fears are misplaced.”\n\nSavita Subramanian of Bank of America Corp. says the index will rally to 1,600 on rising corporate profits and diminishing concerns about the global economy. John Stoltzfus, at Oppenheimer & Co., forecasts the gauge will climb to 1,585 and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s David Kostin estimates 1,575, based on support from the Federal Reserve’s third round of bond purchases. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke pledged in September that the central bank will buy $40 billion of mortgage securities a month until the U.S. labor market recovers.\n\nOptimism is misplaced unless Obama and Republican leaders are able to agree on measures to avoid the mandated cuts and tax increases, according to James Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC in Chicago.\n\nThe $607 billion burden could cause the world’s largest economy to shrink 0.5 percent next year, according to a Nov. 8 Congressional Budget Office report.\n\n“Up until the election day no one had priced in a fiscal cliff because the thinking overwhelmingly on Wall Street was there wasn’t going to be one,” Bianco said in a Nov. 14 Bloomberg Television interview. “We’re only now starting to price it in and we’ve only been pricing it in for a week. If we continue to keep our pencils down, there’s going to be a lot more pain.”\n\nThe economy is recovering at the slowest post-recession rate since World War II, as the housing market stagnated until this year and unemployment stayed above 8 percent through August.\n\nLawmakers of both parties say they want to avoid the fiscal cliff’s economic shock while addressing the deficit. Boehner said Nov. 16 that Republicans are willing to consider revenue- raising measures in exchange for spending cuts. Obama said tax rates should rise without specifying that the top rate must return to the 39.6 percent stipulated.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 has doubled since Obama first took office, the index’s price-earnings ratio was lower than the 16.4 six-decade average for 38 of the rally’s 46 months, as earnings surged, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nThe multiple is up 35 percent since March 2009, compared with the average expansion of 55 percent in bull markets since 1962, Bloomberg data show. For the past 2 1/2 years, the S&P 500 hasn’t climbed higher than 16 times earnings, compared with the average ratio of 17.4 in past rallies.\n\nThe valuation rose to a high of 13.8 from 7.3 during the first 15 months of the 1982 advance that pushed the S&P 500 up 229 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the 1990s rally led by technology companies, it almost doubled to 28.5 during the eight years.\n\n“As a country, we go from glum to glee and glum to glee over and over again,” James Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital Management, which oversees about $325 billion, said in a phone interview. “After the 2008 recession and the tech bubble, we’re back at glum, so what comes next?” he said. “Confidence, and the ability to rebuild it, is our biggest asset for the future.”\n\nEconomists predict global GDP will increase 2.6 percent next year from 2.2 percent in 2012, the slowest since it contracted three years ago, according to a survey by Bloomberg. The pace of U.S. growth will be 2 percent in 2013, down from 2.2 percent this year, according to the median of 98 estimates.\n\nThe tumble since Obama defeated Republican candidate Mitt Romney, with 332 electoral votes to 206, pushed the benchmark gauge to 13.7 times reported profits, lower than the 15.5 average ratio since March 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Only one bull market since 1962 has ended with a lower valuation: the six-year cycle through 1980 in which the index gained 126 percent to 140.52, or 9.1 times profits.\n\nThe ratio averaged 17.4 during the nine rallies and ended at about 19.9. Reaching the mean level would require a 26 percent gain in the S&P 500, holding earnings constant, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Should profits meet analysts’ 2013 projection, the index would need a 42 percent gain from the Nov. 16 closing price. Earnings are forecast to climb to a record $110.80 a share next year, almost double what companies posted in 2008, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n“Valuations are cheap given what we’ve seen in earnings,” said Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co. in Radnor, Pennsylvania. His firm oversees $6.5 billion in assets. “Corporate America is strong, balance sheets are exceptionally strong and flush with cash. We do not believe we’ll have a contraction in earnings next year. We expect profit growth to re-accelerate in the second half of 2013.”\n\nApple, which has fallen 25 percent from its high of $702.10 on Sept. 19 traded at 11.9 times reported profits, a 14 percent discount to its five-year average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The ratio reached a record 23.3 times income 2 1/2 years ago, even after the Cupertino, California-based company posted record earnings in the first quarter.\n\nProfits for Dollar Tree, which sells everything from toys to pet food for $1 or less, will rise 24 percent in fiscal 2013, ending in January, and 13 percent the next year, according to analyst estimates. While the shares have almost tripled since March 2009, the price-earnings ratio at 16.7 is 21 percent below the five-year average.\n\nSouthwest Airlines Co. (LUV) trades 22 percent below its historic valuation, even though earnings at the Dallas-based company have surpassed analyst projections for the past five quarters and are forecast to rise 65 percent in 2013. The shares are up 4.3 percent in 2012.\n\nOf the 500 companies in the index, 245 have price-earnings ratios below their five-year means, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s up from 196 at this time last year and 174 two years ago, the data show.\n\nBull markets “normally finish with a real burst of hyper enthusiasm,” Michael Shaoul, chairman of New York-based Marketfield Asset Management, which oversees $3.5 billion, said in a phone interview. “We haven’t seen the beginning of that yet. The transition from tepid enthusiasm to hyper enthusiasm is going to be worth few hundred points in the S&P.”\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Whitney Kisling in New York at wkisling@bloomberg.net; Inyoung Hwang in New York at ihwang7@bloomberg.net; Rita Nazareth in New York at rnazareth@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net\n\nNov. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Jason Brady, a managing director at Thornburg Investment Management, and John Brady, managing director of interest rate products at R.J.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00005-of-00064--846", "original_text": "Artworld joke: Why are conceptual artists painting again? Answer: Because they think it's a good idea. I tell it to Ellsworth Kelly in the hope that his reaction might throw some light on where he stands. Is he a painter of retinal pictures - that is, art designed to please the eye? Or is he at the other pole, and part of the tribe of heavy thinkers? After half a century in the top rank of international artists, it's still not that clear.\n\n\"Why are conceptual artists painting again? Hmmm ... \" He links his hands behind his head and stares hard at a piece of corner architectural detailing that he had informed me earlier was called a \"squince\". (\"You need it where a square meets a dome. Helps keep the building up.\") \"What is a good idea in painting?\" He keeps on staring. \"Let me get it ... Oh, yeah, I forgot, it's a joke. So tell me.\" I tell him. He's very good about it. \"That's very good!\" It's the way I tell 'em. He laughs obligingly.\n\nWe are in the Serpentine Gallery in London, where Kelly's new show opens at the weekend. Though now in his 80s, he is still working with undiminished vigour and a firm commitment to a kind of unsentimental, anti-heroic rhetoric that several decades ago was given the name \"hard-edge abstraction\". Many of the new paintings are reliefs: monochrome canvas on monochrome canvas, yellow on red, red on blue. Others are stacked up in narrow hyperchromatic bands of colour, like billboards from which the text has been excised. \"Bright, vulgar, modern colours,\" as David Batchelor has written, \"in bright, vulgar, modern collisions with other bright, vulgar, modern colours.\"\n\nThe colour is applied by hand, by Kelly himself, not studio assistants, but it looks machine-sprayed, mechanical. There's no sign of human intervention, just the calm, laboriously executed uniformity - \"a stunning emptiness\", as it was described when it was new, in the late 1950s.\n\nKelly belongs to the half-generation who came after the abstract expressionists and made their name for being cool, systematic and anti-gestural. He was never the type to mouth off himself, but his young friend and ally, Frank Stella, delighted in rattling the cages of Franz Kline, Willem de Kooning (Jackson Pollock was recently dead) and the other \"painterly painters\" of the New York School for him. Stella attacked the \"transcendental nonsense\" of the by-then legendary splashers and drippers in \"asserting that there is something there besides the paint on the canvas\". \"My painting,\" he said, \"is based on the fact that only what can be seen is there ... I try to keep the paint as good as it was in the can.\"\n\nKelly and Stella met when they were both selected for the landmark Sixteen Americans show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1959. Kelly showed his joiner-panels of bright percussive monochromes, Stella his black bitumen paintings of monotonous \"pinstripes\". \"I felt he knew what I knew,\" Kelly says. \"Right away. I got his phone number and went to see him next day.\"\n\nKelly has always liked the colours used by Mark Rothko, and intended to tell him this when they were introduced at a private view of Rothko's work in the 50s. \"But he just said, 'Don't you think I need a rest?' and walked away from me. He was rather irascible.\"\n\nThere is a painting in the Serpentine show that is based on colours from the less doomy part of Rothko's palette: a large rectangle of orange is combined with smaller rectangles of pale green and yellow. The crucial point for Kelly - it is the one he established his reputation making - is that the three colours are contained within their own discrete panels and not painted on to a single canvas. The hard edges that separate them preserve the integrity of each colour. \"There's no dominance here,\" Kelly says. \"It's like the relationship between the two of us: I'm a body, you're a body. If I did it as a single painting, the orange would be the main colour and the others its satellites. By doing it in panels, each has its own uniqueness. It's the difference between depicted space - a painted image - and literal space. I feel my paintings are fragments of the world and I'm simply digging them up and presenting them. I want to get more into the real world.\"\n\nHe is still jetlagged when we talk, having only recently flown in from New York, where he lives in a small town in upper New York state. He is also still reeling slightly from a television programme he saw in his hotel room the night before.\n\n\"It was about these, I guess, artist brothers in London,\" he says. \"A lot of pornography and violence. I said to my friend, I've never seen anything in America like this. I began thinking: What-am-I-doing?\"\n\nIt seems strange now, at a distance of more than 40 years, to think that his own work was the cause of controversies every bit as strident as those surrounding the Chapmans. Painting was a high-stakes business in New York in those years, with reputations rising and crashing overnight. The \"big two\" warring critics, Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg, were constantly carving out and shifting territories. It was ideologies at dawn. A friend of De Kooning's took issue with him when he saw he had a \"banal\" Ellsworth Kelly print in his studio. \"Kelly names the colours,\" De Kooning said, and Kelly still looks gratified as he repeats this. The cool style might be \"just\" style, just surface, but, as John Cage pointed out, the surface was part of the depth.\n\nKelly had met Cage in Paris in the late 40s. \"He happened to be in the same hotel I was in. This was my studio. I didn't really know who he was, but he made me feel like he liked what I was beginning to do. After he went home, he sent me a letter saying, 'Oh, you better come back to America.' There were interesting artists coming up like Rauschenberg, who was doing the Combines, using stuff off the street, the bed and the goat. I walked in on those, and I was very impressed. They were just the opposite of me. This was the heart of everything.\"\n\nTemperamentally, and in the lowered temperature that was common to their work, Kelly was more in tune with Rauschenberg's friend, Jasper Johns. The three of them were contemporaries. Rauschenberg's and Johns' careers took off like rockets. Kelly's was a slower burn, maybe because, just as New York was becoming the art capital of the world, he had gone to live in Europe.\n\nHe did all the traditional European fine art things: painted landscapes like Bonnard; hired models and drew from the nude. \"And all of a sudden,\" he says, \"I started to think, 'I'm not European.' It was so boring to have to paint like someone else. I wanted to be a modern artist. I've always wanted to see something that hasn't been done, that you don't find anywhere else. I went to see Brancusi in his studio. I think he was an influence.\"\n\nHe tells a parable-like tale about the day he nearly met one of his heroes, Picasso. \"I was walking past his Paris studio when a big car with a chauffeur pulled right up on the sidewalk. I was pressed against the wall. I looked in and smiled in recognition. It was Picasso. 'Do I know you?' He opened the door. If I'd got in that car, my whole life could have been different.\"\n\nKelly had said he didn't want a tape recorder used for the interview. I'd attributed that to high aesthetic reasons along the lines of Yves Klein's belief that \"colour is enslaved by the line that becomes writing\" (or something). But it turned out to be more personal. \"I used to have a speech impediment when I was young,\" he explains. \"I'm not a quick thinker. There's always been a gap between what I'm saying and what I'm thinking. I hate to read what I've said written down. I'm slow. So I find it difficult watching films, for example. The TV. Everything's so fast. I want to look. I want time. Time to me is very important. Watching the light change in that doorway over there in the past hour, for instance. I want my painting to be like that. In the realness of it. The shadow along the top is very beautiful.\"\n\nIs he a Buddhist? \"I'm not a believer. I used to meditate when I was a kid. I met a woman after I got out of the army. She was quite a woman. She was a faith healer, and I believed in her. She cured my terrible impediment in a week.\"\n\n\"We are ghosts,\" the British abstract painter John Hoyland remembers Kelly telling him once. \"Artists are ghosts. We're there, but nobody knows where we are.\"\n\n\"I said that?\" Kelly says. \"Did I say that?\"\n\nIn the failing light, four identically shaped, kite-like canvases painted blue, red, green and black have started to flicker or shimmer against the high white wall where they are hung. Prompted by the twin strands of ghosts and the army, perhaps, a memory comes to him from his days serving in Europe during the war. \"I was with a camouflage regiment. We had just found an abandoned truck full of bottles of white wine. I had set my tent up a little distance away from where the others had theirs and I was headed back to it with a book and one of these bottles of wine when this car came by. It stopped, and it was Hemingway. We registered each other. But nothing,\" Kelly says. \"No words.\"\n\nSilence again. \"A painting is like a life,\" he says at length, making an arc in the air with his hand. \"I like to leave it here - a little unfinished. Half-open or maybe a quarter-open. And not exactly about something. It's mostly about perception. I guess I have to satisfy my eyes. A [Donald] Judd was finished.

These high-end homes in the city’s historic neighborhoods frequently attract multiple offers and often sell above the listing price, real estate agents say.\n\nDetroit is a city of empty lots and faded or abandoned homes, and the poverty rate is more than twice the national average. Many blue-collar workers live in suburban bungalows, and executives own sprawling homes in the suburban cities of Grosse Pointe or Bloomfield Hills.\n\nMany people are not aware of Detroit’s mansion districts, where auto barons and wealthy business owners spared no expense to build homes from 1900 to 1929. Homes in the Palmer Woods neighborhood have living rooms large enough to seat 110 at a jazz concert. Some come with carriage houses and basement bars big enough for 50 guests.\n\n“Homes that are move-in ready get heated action — multiple offers within the first week,” said Ryan Cooley, who leads O’Connor Realty and landed Sneed and MacKinnon their home. Some receive eight or more offers, he said.\n\nIn September, MacKinnon and Sneed moved into a stately 1923 brick home with room for an art studio for Sneed, guest rooms for visits by nieces and nephews, and a home office for their Yankee Peddler animation and design company. They beat out several other offers for the home in Indian Village, one of the half-dozen Detroit neighborhoods where mansions and luxury homes or condominiums are found.\n\n[Why this 24-year-old is buying up abandoned homes in Detroit]\n\nBetty J. Warmack has sold homes in Detroit, mainly in Indian Village, for more than 30 years and says she has never seen this much demand and multiple offers. “I sold an attorney from New York a house, a psychiatrist from New York a house and a blogger” from Europe bought in Indian Village, a neighborhood on Detroit’s east side that is on the National Historic Register, she said. “It’s quite a comeback.”\n\nHomes that four years ago rarely sold for more than $200,000 fetch twice that amount if they are ready for their new owners to move in, real estate agents say.\n\nAbout 15 homes sold for $500,000 or more last year through October, more than double the seven high-end sales for the same period in 2014, according to Realcomp, which runs the city’s multiple-listing service.\n\nA few carry price tags of more than $1 million, a rarefied amount that only one Detroit home has sold for since 2006. That home, the Alfred J. Fisher mansion in Palmer Woods, went for $1.6 million in 2014 — more than homes in the tony suburbs fetched that year, according to Realcomp. It sold again last year, for $1.55 million to General Motors President Daniel Ammann and his wife, Pernilla, a partner in a New York advertising agency. (A high-profile mansion once owned by Motown Records founder Berry Gordy Jr. in the Boston-Edison neighborhood was taken off the market in July.)\n\nAustin Black II, a broker and owner of City Living Detroit, says he is amazed at how many executives have decided that it’s time to live in the city of Detroit, because for years they would house-hunt only in the nicer suburbs, where there were 217 million-dollar homes that sold in 2014 and 229 through October, Realcomp data shows. Inventory in the city has been low for months, Black said, with only a handful of homes for sale in prime neighborhoods. It’s gotten so tight, he said, that he has gone door to door in a few neighborhoods seeking people who are ready to put their homes up for sale.\n\n“I have 20 or so clients who are ready and able to purchase a home right now. Inventory doesn’t exist,” Black said.\n\n[Michael Bolton is trying to save Detroit. Yes, that Michael Bolton.]\n\nDemand in the mansion districts is so high and inventory so low, Black and others say, that some buyers are opting for adjoining neighborhoods, with stately but less elegant homes.\n\nThe rising home prices may begin to persuade current homeowners to cash in their mansions and elegant abodes, some of which could fetch record or near record prices. But “because the market is doing so well lately, some sellers get aggressive with pricing” and those homes sell much slower, Black said.\n\nTo many, the influx of new residents is one of several signs that Detroit may finally be on a roll.\n\nQuicken Loans Chairman Dan Gilbert, a Detroit native, is one of the city’s largest commercial landowners, purchasing more than 80 properties downtown for $2.2 billion. And the Kresge and Skillman foundations, JPMorgan Chase and others have committed millions of dollars to revitalization.\n\nStill, those efforts are not enough to jump-start the real estate market and undo the prolonged structural decline of Detroit’s housing stock. So city officials have introduced efforts to either raze or auction abandoned houses. And a community bank is experimenting with a program to renovate vacant houses and, if necessary, absorb a loss to sell them to buyers who may not qualify for traditional loans.\n\nDetroit has neighborhoods that have been ravaged by years of neglect and middle-class flight. It’s a city where dozens of homes are purchased at auction for as little as $1,000 to $7,000. That helps explain why in Detroit and three adjoining cities, homes sold for a median price of $20,158 through October of last year, which is up from the $15,011 median in 2014 and more than double the median price of $9,751 in 2012, according to Realcomp.\n\nDespite an influx of entrepreneurs, artists and hipsters, Detroit’s population fell from 951,000 in 2000 to about 680,250 in 2014. So new residents are moving into a city full of contrasts: Population and employment bases­ have declined for decades; crime and insurance for home and auto are high. Yet new restaurants and art galleries are opening, and high-end shops are starting to show up from New York, Germany and elsewhere.\n\n[For downtrodden Detroit, hopes of revitalization ride streetcar rails]\n\nDemand for larger luxurious homes may be an indication of Detroit’s comeback; buying has heated up since the city filed for bankruptcy in July 2013 (it emerged about 17 months later). Tech start-ups and boutiques have opened, and investors from China and Europe started buying commercial properties or blocks of homes, many in marginal neighborhoods.\n\nSneed and MacKinnon said they knew that the market was competitive and that they wanted a home in Indian Village, citing its architectural beauty and proximity to the Detroit River and Belle Isle, a 985-acre island park.\n\nSo they moved to Detroit in frigid February and rented a loft near downtown. “I wanted . . . to be ready when spring hit for any houses on the market,” MacKinnon said. “We wanted a beautiful, craftsman, old historic home.”\n\nThey looked at eight homes and then saw the one they bought: a 4,878-square-foot property on a double lot filled this past summer with peonies, hostas and wind chimes. The Georgian revival has a big homey kitchen and a beautiful fireplace in the living room, four bedrooms on the second floor, and a third-floor office and fifth bedroom. It was spacious without being grand and just felt right from the moment they walked in, MacKinnon said.\n\nSo they were aggressive and offered $430,000 — well above the $395,000 asking price. The owner accepted in two days. They have learned about their home’s history from him: It was built in 1923 at a cost of $12,750 for W.J. Davidson, who worked in General Motors’ executive offices, and was said to be a wedding present.\n\nDespite being self-employed, Sneed and MacKinnon had pre-qualified for a larger loan, so they landed a mortgage quickly using a local lender. Home insurance was a bit trickier, but after shopping around, they are satisfied with the policy’s $2,400 annual premium.\n\nTheir new home requires some improvements — paint and hardwood floors, electrical and fire- and security-alarm upgrades — but basically it was ready for them to move in, except for cleaning out items left in the basement and a few small repairs. “We have had personal invites to join Thanksgiving parties and 100-year house parties, which is something that never happened in Los Angeles. Back there we never knew our neighbors,” MacKinnon said.\n\n[JPMorgan is betting $100 million on Detroit. Can it leverage a lot more?]\n\nFamily members have come for visits, including MacKinnon’s mother and sister, who have shown up three times, she said. Other guests say they were misinformed about Detroit, from negative headlines, and appreciated the food culture, parks and how easy it is to get downtown.\n\nFor some higher-priced deals, buyers need to put down more cash because their homes may not appraise at the prices they are paying, some agents said. Some offer all-cash purchases — an easy choice for New Yorkers who sell their $3 million apartment and buy a $500,000 mansion. About 40 percent of high-end purchases are all-cash sales, Cooley estimates. Nationwide, 27 percent of housing purchases were all cash in November, often by investors, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nValrie Honablue, a psychiatrist who grew up in Panama, paid cash for her first Detroit home in 2010. She was living in Atlanta when she read about Motown’s real estate opportunities. “The prices are so low; something is wrong,” she said. So she drove to the city to see for herself. She bought one in Indian Village. Shortly after moving to Detroit, she left for “the job of a lifetime” but bounced back within two years, drawn by “the people and the possibilities” and the beautiful homes.\n\nHer second Detroit home had been vacant for 17 years when she bought it in June 2014. She got it for a bargain price but expects to spend five or six years renovating it, partly to spread out the improvement costs.\n\nWarmack, her agent, calls her “the pied piper of Detroit.” A dozen people have followed her to the city and bought homes.\n\nMany who move to Detroit bring their jobs or businesses with them. Sneed and MacKinnon are among them.\n\n“We just couldn’t get ahead” in Los Angeles, Sneed said. Now after nearly a year in Detroit, they operate their Yankee Peddler animation company from a loft, own a huge home with oversize gardens, and have made new friends who clue them into culture, festivals, dog parks and more.\n\n“We know we’re taking a gamble. . . . But there’s a passion here,” Sneed said. They have turned into Detroit boosters and are eager to celebrate their home’s 100th birthday in seven years. Said MacKinnon: “I can’t believe I live on this street. It blows me away how beautiful these streets are.”", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nErica MacKinnon and Bill Sneed have lived all over the world and spent a couple of years in a rented Los Angeles duplex considering whether to move to Miami or Seattle, Oakland or Portland, Maine.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00006-of-00064--1071", "original_text": "When Apple created major buzz around a new product in the past few years, it was almost always an iPhone or iPad. That’s why it’s so refreshing to see the world ooh and aah about an Apple computer again, the MacBook Pro With Retina Display.\n\nIt certainly looks great on paper — a cutting-edge laptop loaded with the latest tech and a jaw-droppingly sharp screen. But does it really deliver the goods?\n\nThe answer isn’t just yes. It’s “oh, baby.” Within minutes of taking our review sample out of the box here at the Mashable offices, a crowd of staffers gathered around to see what visions the glorious 2,880 x 1,800 retina display would show them.\n\nIt didn’t disappoint. After setting up the laptop and putting it side by side with a six-month-old MacBook Pro with the same-size screen, the difference was apparent to anyone with eyes.\n\nAlso apparent: How crazy thin this machine is — just 0.71 of an inch thick, or 0.03 inch thicker than the 13-inch MacBook Air. However, it’s a mite heftier at 4.46 pound to the Air’s roughly 3 pounds.\n\nIf you’re used to the Air or some of the sleeker Ultrabooks like the Dell XPS 13, the retina Pro’s is still a size class above. However, it’s still significantly less bulky than the regular Pro, and still fits in the same bags.\n\nBack to that screen. Perhaps surprisingly, the first thing you notice is the deeper colors, not necessarily the sharpness — although that becomes clear when viewing photos with lots of detail. Browsing through the Flickr feed of the NASA Goddard Space Center, the crowd could see those extra pixels working to show, say, the wispy clouds in satellite shots of earth.\n\nVirtually all images were displayed with more vibrant colors and better contrast than on the older Pro.\n\nIt’s not just photos that benefit from the extra pixels, but text and iconography as well. Everything from the system fonts to app icons to the galactic background image looks sharper, with better contrast.\n\nAfter I connected the retina Pro to an external (non-retina) Acer monitor, it became something of a game to drag windows from one screen to the other, watching the images and text magically transform as they crossed from edge to edge, becoming crisper and more affecting.\n\nWhen you venture outside Apple apps, however, the experience isn’t so improved. Sometimes it’s actually worse than what you had before. Text in third-party web browsers like Chrome and Firefox appears jagged and pixelated because those apps aren’t rendering for retina resolutions.\n\nAlthough those app developers will issue updates that will address those issues (Google is already doing so with Chrome), it emphasizes how new this screen tech is. Eventually, ultra-high-resolution displays will become more common. But for now the retina MacBook is an outlier, and early adopters will pay the price in non-optimized apps, at least for a while.\n\nThere’s one way around that issue, of course: Just stick with Apple apps, which appear to be all retina-ready. iPhoto (see the screenshot below) and Aperture in particular take tremendous advantage of the screen, and if you can bear to browse the web with Safari (and judging by the browser stats for Mashable readers, you can’t), your eyes will be satisfied.\n\nIt actually got me surfing with Apple’s browser for more than 5 minutes for the first time in years.\n\nIt’s worth noting that by default, the retina display scales the screen so everything is the same size as it would be on a regular MacBook Pro. If you really enjoy squinting, though, you can use the streamlined display settings to make more use of your pixels. Everything will appear smaller, but you’ll get more on the screen, and the processor can handle it.\n\nThat processor, by the way, is an Intel third-generation (Ivy Bridge) quad-core Core i7, with a clock speed of either 2.3 or 2.6GHz (Turbo Boostable to 3.3 or 3.6GHz). It’s augmented by a discrete graphics processor, an Nvidia GeForce GT 650M with 1GB of dedicated memory (the laptop itself comes with 8GB, though you can configure it with 16GB at purchase).\n\nThat’s some serious power, but the retina Pro really needs it to drive all those pixels, particularly for graphics-intensive exercises, like video editing.\n\nIn addition to the meaty processing power, the new Pro has another performance advantage: a solid-state flash drive for storage. Since the drive doesn’t have moving parts like a hard disk has, the laptop can “lift” data off the drive faster, adding to the speed of the machine.\n\nJust what can you do with that kind of power? We aimed to find out by re-creating a demo that Apple reps showed us: playing four simultaneous full HD video streams in Final Cut Pro X and making live cuts between them.\n\nWe made sure all the streams were all uncompressed 1080i files at 60 frames per second, cued them up, then watched for any stuttering or other problems. Check out the results in this video:\n\nIn our test, all the clips played just fine in the inspector window, never tripping up as we made rapid-fire cuts between them — an impressive feat. Apple says this is one of the abilities the solid-state drive bestows, and that the retina Pro is the only machine that can play four full-HD clips simultaneously.\n\nThe flash drive also speeds things up when copying files, but even better in that regard is the upgrade to USB 3.0. The retina MacBook Pro isn’t alone in getting better USB — all of Apple’s new laptops have it (native support for USB 3.0 comes hand-in-hand with Intel’s Ivy Bridge processors).\n\nStill, it’s a welcome change, as is relocating one of the ports to the right side of the chassis, à la the MacBook Air.\n\nUSB 3.0 and flash storage are a great combo, though its benefits will be best realized with USB 3.0 devices. When I tried offloading a big 3.84GB file from the most common thing users will likely use — a USB thumb drive — it took an 7 minutes, 3 seconds. That was better than the old MacBook Pro, which took almost 10 minutes, but not as awesome as you’d think.\n\nAlthough the improved USB ports are on all MacBooks now, the retina Pro boasts a connector that isn’t: a full-size HDMI port. This is the first time an Apple laptop has included HDMI, and Apple says it’s because its customers demanded it.\n\nIt’s pretty obvious why — to watch video services like Netflix on a big-screen TV. Apple may have been reluctant to include HDMI until now to avoid subverting its own Apple TV box. Could the appearance of HDMI on the retina MacBook signal that Apple isn’t as concerned about that anymore, possibly because it has bigger plans for the living room?\n\nWe’ll leave that question unanswered for now, and instead say that the HDMI connection is welcome and worked well upon connection to one of the Sony TVs here at the Mashable offices.\n\nGenerally, you’ll probably want to mirror displays when connecting to a TV (see the pic below), though that will letterbox the screen on the pro to a 16:9 ratio while you’re connected.\n\nRounding out the jacks on the new Pro are an SDXC card slot (technically capable of reading cards up to 2TB, though cards have only gotten as big as 128GB) and two Thunderbolt ports — the fastest connector available on Apple gear. Those are where you’ll connect external monitors, drives and those adapters for Ethernet and FireWire, both of which do not appear on this machine.\n\nWhich leads to an important factor: You’ll definitely need some accessories to enjoy the fruits of a full-featured laptop. Besides those adapters, you’ll likely need an external optical drive for the few times you’ll want to read an old CD-ROM or burn a DVD. Be prepared: Your final price tag will likely be more than you thought.\n\nAlso, the MagSafe power adapter is a different design from the regular MacBook Pro. Since the retina Pro is so thin, it had to be flattened a little, plus it discards the L-shaped connector on the recent Pros with more conventional plug design that came before it and is still used by the Air. That means older power adapters are incompatible with the new Pro — an important detail if you have an external Apple display that also powers your machine via MagSafe (Apple does sell an adapter, however).\n\nOther changes MacBook Pro veterans will notice: The power button has a new home, right where the Eject button for the DVD drive used to be (no need for that anymore). There are also some curious omissions: First, the rarely-used Audio input is gone — there’s just a solitary headphone jack now. Also absent are the handy battery-status button, its accompanying LEDs, the sleep indicator and the infrared sensor. You sacrifice a lot to have a thin body, apparently. Thankfully the keyboard is still backlit.\n\nYou can see some of those absences in the photo below, which shows the MacBook Air, Retina Pro and Pro, all stacked together (more comparisons in the gallery).\n\nThe speakers in the retina Pro have clearly been given some vitamins, although users probably won’t notice until they cue up Spotify or iTunes. Listening to Ahead by a Century by the Tragically Hip on both machines, it was easier to pick out the individual voices among the band members on the retina MacBook, and the soundstage felt wider overall, with deeper bass.\n\nHelpfully, the fan is whisper-quiet.\n\nTaking a step back, it’s beautiful to see so much cutting-edge technology put into a laptop: The latest processors, discrete graphics, high-speed connectivity, up to 16GB of RAM, a flash drive that can be as massive as 768GB — and of course that ultra-high-res screen.\n\nSuch a package comes with a price: It starts at $2,199, and that’s just with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It should really be called the MacBook Pro With Retina Screen And An Eye-Popping Price Tag.\n\nYou get what you pay for, though, and in this case it’s a ticket to the future. More than even Intel has done with Ultrabooks, Apple has, with the retina MacBook Pro, drawn a dividing line between old laptops and the ones we’ll be using in the coming years.\n\nWith retina, it’s effectively obsoleted all of its other laptop designs and given its customers — and competitors — something to aspire to.\n\nPutting the stunning retina display aside, you’ll probably be able to find a Windows machine that can beat it on an individual feature, be it speed, connectivity, convenience or storage. But as a package, nothing offers what this machine does.\n\nThat kind of focus on the breadth of experience is Apple’s bread and butter, and it’s good it see it applied full force to the category it helped invent: the personal computer.\n\nMacBook Pro With Retina Display\n\nThe MacBook Pro With Retina Display is Apple's new flagship MacBook, boasting a quad-core processor, flash drive configurable up to 768GB and an ultra-high-resolution display. It performs extremely well, but carries a high price tag. It's also curiously different from its MacBook Pro cousin in some ways.\n\nThe familiar Apple icon appears upon startup.\n\nThe login screen is the same too, although rendered for the retina display's 2,880 x1,800 pixels.\n\nMacBook Pro vs. Retina MacBook Pro\n\nHere you can see the difference in thickness from the regular 15-inch MacBook Pro (left).\n\nMacBook Air vs. Retina MacBook Pro\n\nCompared with the 13-inch MacBook Air (left).\n\nHere the MacBook Air, Retina MacBook Pro and MacBook Pro are stacked.\n\nMacBook Family, Left Side Connectors\n\nMacBook Family, Right Side Connectors\n\nHere the Retina Pro (left) and regular model are displaying the same photo, at the same screen settings. Note the extra detail in the clouds on the retina screen.\n\nWhen mirroring to an HDTV via the HDMI output, the screen is letterboxed.\n\nIf text isn't optimized for the retina display, it can look jagged, as in the Chrome browser (a fix is in the works).\n\nText is sharper than ever in Apple's web browser.\n\nThe retina screen normally scales imagery to match the size you'd see on normal 15-inch laptops, but you can adjust it to fill more of the screen if you wish.\n\nHere is the retina display used to its fullest. Text is tiny, but you can fit much more on the screen.\n\nOn the opposite end of the scale, everything is magnified. Note that in Safari, text stays crisp.\n\nThe retina MacBook Pro can cut between multiple full-HD streams playing simultaneously.\n\nFinder windows are still readable when they're shrunk in Mission Control.\n\nWhen seen under a magnifying glass, the enhancements of the retina screen are apparent.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00003-of-00064--1055", "original_text": "My first encounter with The Hobbit as a movie was that old Jules Bass, Arthur Rankin musical-cartoon (animated by the Studio Ghibli precursor that went on to produce Hayao Miyazaki’s Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind). It was probably your first encounter, too, if you were a five-year-old (or thereabouts) in 1977. Orson Bean as Bilbo, John Huston as Gandalf, Glenn Yarbrough crooning “It’s time you stop thinkin’ and wasting the day” at high-throttle vibrato — those were the days, thank you childhood nostalgia-goggles.\n\nThe Rankin/Bass film was nominated for a Hugo Award for “Dramatic Presentation,” believe it or not (though in my signed copy of The Annotated Hobbit, Tolkien scholar Douglas Anderson refers to the TV version as “execrable” — perhaps he’s confused it with the 1980 Rankin/Bass Ralph Bakshi followup, The Return of the King, which really was a mess).\n\nThe 1997 version of The Hobbit was also broadcast at 30 frames per second (FPS), the analog standard for American television from 1953 until mid-2009 (for color, anyway — black and white came earlier). Believe it or not, that’s actually six frames per second faster than the international standard for cinematic film: 24 FPS.\n\n(MORE: (Reworked) Movie Trailer: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey)\n\nWe’ve taken 24 FPS for granted as filmgoers since the mid-1920s. In spite of that lower frame rate, it’s what makes movies look, well, like movies.\n\nWhy 24 FPS and not 26, 34, 43 or 59? Because film stock was expensive — the slower it moves through the projector, the less you need. Early silent films were shot at frame speeds in the teens, in fact, but when sound was added in 1926, the frame rate had to be fast enough (and continuous) to eliminate audio chop. The speed at which you achieve sufficient audio-visual parity? Twenty-four frames per second.\n\nThe trouble with 24 FPS is that it always represented a commercial compromise. While it defines what we think of as a movie today, it has deficiencies like motion blurring or strobing. If you’re filming in 3D they’re even more noticeable. Filmmaker James Cameron talked about this in a Variety interview just before Avatar came out.\n\nFor three-fourths of a century of 2-D cinema, we have grown accustomed to the strobing effect produced by the 24 frame per second display rate. When we see the same thing in 3-D, it stands out more, not because it is intrinsically worse, but because all other things have gotten better. Suddenly the image looks so real it’s like you’re standing there in the room with the characters, but when the camera pans, there is this strange motion artifact. It’s like you never saw it before, when in fact it’s been hiding in plain sight the whole time. Some people call it judder, others strobing. I call it annoying. It’s also easily fixed, because the stereo renaissance is enabled by digital cinema, and digital cinema supplies the answer to the strobing problem.\n\nIf film stock hadn’t been so expensive, and the standard chosen had been higher, say Thomas Edison’s recommendation that film be at least 46 FPS (“Anything less will strain the eye,” said Edison, according to British filmmaker Kevin Brownlow), the whole history of film might be different. Edison wasn’t alone: According to cinema historian H.A.V. Bulleid, apparently in Edison’s camp, “To obviate [remove] flicker from white light projected on a bright surface requires about 48 obscurations per second.”\n\nEdison and Bulleid have a friend in Cameron. Here he is again, from that 2008 Avatar interview.\n\n…right now, today, we could be shooting 2-D movies at 48 frames and running them at that speed. This alone would make 2-D movies look astonishingly clear and sharp, at very little extra cost, with equipment that’s already installed or being installed … I’ve run tests on 48 frame per second stereo and it is stunning. The cameras can do it, the projectors can (with a small modification) do it. So why aren’t we doing it, as an industry?\n\nWe’re about to find out if Edison and Bulleid (and Cameron, and all of 48 FPS’ proponents over the years) were right. Peter Jackson’s The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which premieres worldwide next week on Friday, Dec. 14, was filmed with special RED EPIC cameras capable of recording at an incredible 5,120 by 2,700 pixels, using a motion standard known as High Frame Rate, or HFR, referring to a frame rate greater than 24 FPS — or in this case, exactly double it. If you’re a Jackson wonk or just a film-tech connoisseur, you already know the movie will be displayed in select theaters at 48 FPS.\n\n(MORE: The Hobbit: What We Know So Far About Peter Jackson’s Epic Trilogy)\n\nFor all the technical ballyhoo, it’s a decision that’s elicited both praise and scorn. Critics claim HFR makes films look interpolated, like a soap opera (if you’ve ever watched a soap opera and wondered why it looks nothing like film, it’s because of the interlaced format, 60i, which conveys the illusion of running at a higher frame rate than 30 FPS).\n\nOn the other hand, film critic Roger Ebert described seeing a movie at 48 FPS as “of startling clarity.” Writing about Maxivision 48, inventor Dean Goodhill’s 1999 standard for 48 FPS, 35mm film, Ebert said it “achieves a picture quality better than anything you’ve seen: Four times as good, in fact.”\n\n(If you want to see HFR in action, RED offers an overview of frame rates with comparison videos here.)\n\nPeter Jackson took to Facebook a few weeks ago to defend his decision to film and display his The Hobbit trilogy at 48 FPS.\n\nNow, in the digital age, there’s no reason whatsoever to stick to 24 fps. We didn’t get it perfect in 1927. Science tells us that the human eye stops seeing individual pictures at about 55 fps. Therefore, shooting at 48 fps gives you much more of an illusion of real life. The reduced motion blur on each frame increases sharpness and gives the movie the look of having been shot in 65mm or IMAX. One of the biggest advantages is the fact that your eye is seeing twice the number of images each second, giving the movie a wonderful immersive quality. It makes the 3D experience much more gentle and hugely reduces eyestrain. Much of what makes 3D viewing uncomfortable for some people is the fact that each eye is processing a lot of strobing, blur and flicker. This all but disappears in HFR 3D.\n\nBut so far, the response in early reviews of the film, which premiered in New Zealand on Nov. 28, has been less than flattering.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter‘s Todd McCarthy leans negative, writing “The results are interesting and will be much-debated, but an initial comparison of the two formats [the 24 FPS vs. 48 FPS versions] weighs against the experiment.” For Variety, Peter Debruge says “[Everything] takes on an overblown, artificial quality in which the phoniness of the sets and costumes becomes obvious, while well-lit areas bleed into their surroundings, like watching a high-end homemovie.” And Movieline’s Jen Yamato is witheringly critical, writing “It felt like watching daytime soaps in HD, terrible BBC broadcasts, or Faerie Tale Theater circa 1985, only in amazingly sharp clarity and with hobbits.”\n\n(LIST: Top 10 Alternative Places to Film The Hobbit)\n\nTIME’s own Richard Corliss is somewhat more positive about the experience in his review, writing:\n\nThe clarity of the image is sometimes magical, occasionally migraine-inducing … At first, in the Smaug battle, I thought I was watching a video game: pellucid pictures of indistinct creatures. After a while my eyes adjusted, as to a new pair of glasses, but it’s still like watching a very expensively mounted live TV show on the world’s largest home-TV screen.\n\nWhat does 48 FPS look like? It’s hard to say — something you’re left using vague adjectives synonymous with “clarity” to describe. It’s one of those things you know when you see it, even if there’s a sight/explanation translation hangup. I know the — what’s the phrase I’m looking for…”visual intimacy”? — of soap operas always seemed a little weird, conditioned as I was by the time I paid any attention to a soap opera to associate “serious” filmmaking with 24-FPS cinema. I now equate that soap opera “look” with melodramatic visual storytelling, so it’ll probably take some time for my prefrontal cortex to come around.\n\nIn any case, most theaters aren’t equipped to show films at 48 FPS, so you’ll only be able to see it at the higher frame rate in select locations. If you want to know which ones, check for the HFR acronym in the billing. I’m not sure it’s possible to see the film in HFR but not 3D, so bear that in mind. Speaking as a guy with disdain for stereoscopic 3D in any medium, regardless of whether The Hobbit‘s a well-made film in terms of the craft, I’m curious to see if HFR changes my opinion about 3D.\n\nWhat do you think, filmgoers? Planning to see The Hobbit in HFR 3D? Or will you hunt for a theater showing the film in good old-fashioned 24 frames per second?

General Electric photo.\n\nThe old SONY factory located in eastern Japan’s Miyagi Prefecture is up and running again. This time around, however, it’s been resurrected as something else entirely: an indoor farm that, at 25,000 square feet, is the largest of its kind.\n\nAs is the case with other indoor farms, crops are grown in conditions that hardly resemble conventional agriculture. Here, farm workers, dressed in white lab coats and face masks, take great care in maintaining a sterile environment to ensure that the vast majority of produce are harvested in a state of optimal freshness. The humid climate inside is managed with precision and rather than using soil, the plants are raised hydroponically, a method where nutrients and fertilizer is drip-fed and absorbed through recycled water in a measured, controlled manner.\n\nBut the sprawling Mirai lettuce farm has a significant edge over the rest. In interviews, Shigeharu Shimamura, a botanist who serves as the company’s president, touts that, with just 1 percent of the water that’s used for irrigation, his lettuce grows more than twice as fast as lettuce grown outdoors. This translates to an average of 10,000 heads shipped out each day.\n\nThe trick, he says, is in the lighting. Designed by General Electric, the LED fixtures sitting atop each stacked row of lettuce are programmed to automatically adjust their illumination in a cycle that maximizes photosynthesis during the day and breathing at night. Compared to outdoor farms, it’s estimated that artificially accelerating the maturation process can boost crop yields by as much as 50 percent. And while indoor farms typically use florescent lighting, LEDs are much more efficient, consuming 40 percent less energy.\n\nShimamura also says that lettuce grown on the site are healthier. Having the capability to meticulously engineer how each head is produced, allows his team to produce a variation of romaine lettuce that contains eight to 10 times more beta-carotene and two times the vitamin C, Calcium and Magnesium.\n\n“The process for growing Mirai lettuce is leaf type, and not head type, so 95 percent of the portion is edible and can used conveniently at restaurants for salads and sandwiches,” Shimamura says. “In terms of quality, since Mirai leaf lettuce is fresh and soft, they are praised by children and the elderly as easy to eat.” They also are quite tasty, he says.\n\nIn a way, the company’s newest facility may serve as a working vision of things to come. Researchers have warned that, as access to arable land and fresh water supplies dwindles, commercial agricultural systems will no longer be sufficient enough to feed a rapidly rising global population that’s expected to exceed 10 billion by 2050.\n\nTo remedy the situation, these experts have said, would require moving away from industry practices that have long been wasteful. For instance, while farming accounts for 70 percent of water usage, most of it is lost because of inefficient irrigation methods, according to a report by the World Water Forum. A separate report, compiled by Britain’s Institution of Mechanical Engineers, also found that roughly half of the world’s produce is discarded, partly due to an abundance of crops failing to meet market standards.\n\nJapan, on the other hand, is already home to 380 enclosed farms dedicated to raising not only high-quality lettuce, but also spinach, strawberries and other produce. Local electronics giants Fujitsu, Toshiba and Panasonic have all gotten into the game, converting some of their old factories into high-tech farms. Aiding the nationwide overhaul is the country’s current administration, which recently expanded its subsidy and assistance program for those working on “advanced agriculture” projects, like the one undertaken by Mirai.\n\n“Early tests showed that using LED for growing vegetables works, but the kinds of challenges we would face for using it in a large scale factory was still unknown,” Shimamura says. “The Japanese government (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) supported us, trusting the proven test data.”\n\nOne drawback is that fruits and vegetables grown at high-tech facilities tend to be significantly more expensive. A comparison by the Wall Street Journal found that a head of lettuce from a factory can retail for three times as much as other options. But now, with a system that results in higher yields and better overall efficiency, Shimamura says the company is able to sell lettuce at a price point that’s competitive with offerings from traditional farms.\n\nMirai, which runs 25 plant factories, plans to expand its operations overseas and open facilities in Mongolia, Hong Kong, Russia and China. Shimamura and his team are also exploring ways to adapt their indoor farming system to grow a wider range of crops.\n\n“I’d like to try some business that combines factory techniques and traditional agriculture, but mostly I’d like people to know that factory-grown vegetables are ultimately safe,” he says. “So far people have had little opportunity to taste them but I expected that to change in the future.”\n\nSECTION: {section=national/on-innovations, subsection=null}!!!

All able-bodied men of fighting age were eligible — but those rich enough to pay $300 could buy their way out, or bribe someone to take their place.\n\nMoreover, the city’s vocal corps of volunteer firemen — traditionally exempt from military service as a tribute to their community service — were now fair game.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: NEWSERS TRAIN LIKE THE BRAVEST\n\nIn fact, several city firemen were among those whose names had been called in the first round of the draft on Friday, July 11.\n\nWhen military officials convened again two days later, on Monday, July 13, at the provost marshals’ office on Third Ave. and 46th St., they were met by an angry but controlled mob. The aggravated throng waved “No Draft” signs and heckled pedestrians.\n\nAll that was needed was a spark to the tinder, and it came from a quarter nobody expected: New York City’s volunteer firefighters.\n\nA horde of red-shirted smoke eaters from the Black Joke fire company jumped into the seething swarm, shouting and pushing and hurling rocks.\n\nSeveral of their members, including Black Joke captain Peter Masterson, had been among those conscripted in Friday’s draft — and they were there to make sure it didn’t happen again.\n\nTheir frustration was fuel on a flame to the pack nearby.\n\nWithin minutes, the protesters smashed into the provost’s office. A blaze, rumored to be the work of Black Joke firefighters, flared from the building next door, spreading with incredible velocity.\n\nThe actions of the mob devolved with equal speed. The yelling and shoving morphed into violent looting and random attacks on passersby.\n\nAlarm bells rang around the city as the rich shuttered their doors, police ran frantically into the streets and volunteer firefighters — unaware some of their own were implicated in the furor — whipped their horses into action.\n\nThey found themselves battling rabid rioters who pelted them with rocks and killed the firehouse horses in an effort to increase the mayhem and let Manhattan burn.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, the mob gathered in front of a vulnerable target: the Orphan Asylum for Colored Children on Fifth Ave. in Midtown.\n\nThieves ransacked it as men from Engine Co. 18 labored to evacuate 200 black children out the back door to safety.\n\nInside, Fire Chief John Decker and his firefighters fought off the rioters, doing everything in their power to block the mob’s attempts to set the orphanage ablaze.\n\nOver the next five days, New York City’s infamous Draft Riots raged.\n\nCarnage, pillaging, burning and lynching rained down on the city — and black residents in particular — until it finally burned itself out on Friday, July 17.\n\nOut of the ashes of America’s worst urban riot, the world’s greatest professional fire department was born.\n\nHistory has held the Black Joke volunteer fire company in low esteem for its role in the 1863 Draft Riots.\n\nBut in truth, its feisty, rebellious way of dealing with heavy-handed authority was one of the trademarks of New York City’s colorful bands of volunteer firefighters.\n\nEver since the first big ships sailed into the pristine waters of New York’s harbor in the early 1600s, settlers relied on civic duty to protect their rustic wooden homes.\n\nThe uncontrolled destruction of fires continued to terrorize the flammable city even two centuries later — as it transformed into a teeming metropolis that overran most of Manhattan.\n\nNothing could devastate the burgeoning wealth of Manhattan’s influential mercantile class like a burning blaze — and city elders were rightfully concerned.\n\nIn the decades leading up to the Draft Riots, attempts were made to organize the volunteer firefighters who were hometown heroes — devilish and beloved at once.\n\nOften clad in bright red shirts, with caps on their heads and suspenders over their backs, the vollies — artisans, carpenters, gunsmiths and laborers by day — lived and died to serve in their local firehouses.\n\nThey raced to fires on horse-drawn carriages, used leather hoses to douse flames and pumped water into their old-fashioned tankers with boundless energy.\n\nNY'S OLDEST RETIRED BRAVEST IS 104\n\nThe crew of 1,400 firemen also had an inter-departmental rivalry that turned fire calls into foot races — with each firehouse vying to be the first to get water pumping at a scene.\n\nWhen tempers flared, fists went flying, as local historian Augustine Costello wrote one day after witnessing Engine Co. 15, from Mulberry St., tangle with Lady Washington’s Co. 40, a volunteer unit from what is now Chinatown.\n\n“The shock of battle rolled down the line ... one thousand sturdy, stalwart fellows were fiercely grappling with each other in a hand-to-hand fight. The din was frightful,” Costello wrote.\n\n“The fighters were so thick that there was scarcely any room to fall.”\n\nAmong those in the fray was Moses Humphreys, of Engine Co. 40, a newspaper printer for the New York Sun who doubled as a volunteer firefighter. He’s believed to be the real-life inspiration for Big Mose, a beloved figure of urban folklore who was “8-feet tall with Virginia ham-sized fists” and worked with a beer keg strapped to his leg.\n\nLike Humphreys, Big Mose was a member of legendary Five Points gang, the Bowery Boys. The Dead Rabbits and Pug Uglies and other gangs infested the city’s volunteer firehouses, infusing their firefighting rivalries with an extra layer of hatred.\n\nThere was another larger-than-life character who ran with the gangs and fought fires as a volunteer — and unlike Big Mose, his existence was never in doubt.\n\nWilliam Tweed, better known as Boss Tweed, the man who built a corrupt political empire through the Tammany Hall patronage machine, got his start as a lowly volunteer for Americus Fire Company No. 6, aka “Big Six.”\n\nBy 1863, Boss Tweed had left behind his days as an ax-wielding volunteer firefighter. He was the Tammany puppet master with ties into various city agencies — all of which he mercilessly plundered to the tune of some $200 million.\n\nThe mayhem caused by the 1863 Draft Riots meant stepped-up pressure on state and city officials to clean up the messy ways of undisciplined volunteer firehouses.\n\nThe powerful insurance industry, which took a financial hit anytime it had to pay out on fire claims, raised the largest cry.\n\nIn 1865, elected officials in the state Legislature put an end to the freewheeling fun of volunteer firefighting with a stroke of a pen.\n\nGone were the bright red shirts, the firehouses as community hangouts, the rivalries that energized the men. In their place came paid professionals, wearing dark blue flannel and following strict firehouse rules.\n\nFor the first time, New York City had a corps of paid, professional firefighters — the foundation of the modern-day FDNY.\n\nOn Aug. 1, 1865, the Metropolitan Fire Department invaded the city’s firehouses and kicked out the volunteers. It had a budget to hire 600 men and purchase $564,000 in equipment — and crafty Boss Tweed couldn’t wait to get his hands on it.\n\nPHOENIX SOCIETY IS NEW ORDER OF ASIAN-AMERICAN FIREFIGHTERS\n\nAll he needed was the right puppet in Albany.\n\nIt took three years, but he got his man. Tammany loyalist John T. Hoffman was elected New York’s governor in 1868, and almost immediately set about ramming through the Tweed Charter.\n\nIt stripped the state of control of the fire department, and turned it — and its fat budget — over to the city.\n\nIt was goodbye to the Metropolitan Fire Department, and hello to the Fire Department of the City of New York — otherwise known as the FDNY.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Tweed Charter, little changed in the firefighters’ close-knit world.\n\nThey ate and breathed the job — which required them to work in 151-hour stretches with three breaks a day to go home for hour-long visits.\n\nThe smoke eaters earned roughly $700 a year, but time and time again put their lives on the line for the city’s indebted residents, many of whom lived in crowded, cramped tenements that were veritable death traps.\n\nBut by the time World War II rolled onto America’s shores in 1942, the FDNY was a force to be reckoned with.\n\nMAN REGRETS NEVER REUNITING WITH FIREFIGHTER WHO SAVED HIM\n\nBoss Tweed was long gone. He died in a Ludlow St. jail not long after the FDNY was formed, a victim of his own greed and corruption.\n\nAlso gone were the FDNY’s horses and endless “continuous duty” shifts. In their place were fast-moving fire engines and ladder rigs and regular days.\n\nThe FDNY had nearly 11,000 men in firehouses in all five boroughs. Its members had unionized in every rank, and they enjoyed generous salaries, pensions and benefits.\n\nTheir technology had upgraded too. Thicker, stronger helmets protected their heads. A long, bulky rubberized jacket helped stave off burns. Air tanks made it possible for smoke eaters to survive even the heaviest conditions.\n\nThe firefighting force itself changed, as well.\n\nMore and more firefighters moved out of the neighborhood enclaves they’d grown up in. They headed to the surrounding upstate counties and Long Island, as highways connected new neighborhoods to the city.\n\nBy the early 1920s, the FDNY was no longer the almost-exclusive provenance of white males — although it would take nearly the entire century for African-Americans to get on the job in significant numbers.\n\nBy the early 1980s, women were also banging down the door to confront the significant challenge of integrating all-male firehouses. Three decades later, the FDNY still only has 43 women firefighters — two more than the 41 who originally joined in 1982.\n\nBut even as the FDNY transitioned into the 21st century, many of the basic elements of the job remained the same.\n\nIt’s a career spent exploring filthy basements and hallways on hands and knees in pitch black smoke, slogging up seemingly endless flights of stairs in an increasingly vertical city, responding to crashes, collapses and every kind of disaster — and always with the knowledge that the job could take a firefighters’ life.\n\nSince its creation in 1865, the FDNY has responded to every major calamity in the city and even in its surrounding waterways, from the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in 1911 that killed 146 to the horror of 9/11, which killed 343 members of the department.\n\nFDNY officials said the department’s death toll for its 150-year history stands at 1,143.\n\nEvery October, firefighters gather at a memorial to remember the long list of Bravest who have made the ultimate sacrifice. The memorial, created in 1910 with heavy contributions from among the city’s poorest, was inscribed with a message as true today as it was then:\n\n“To the men of the Fire Department of the City of New York who died at the call of duty, soldiers in a war that never ends.\n\n“This memorial is dedicated by the people of a grateful city.”", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nNew York City burst in flames on the morning of July 13, 1863 — a conflagration of rage and resentment that exploded next to a draft office in Midtown.

The Ethiopian government has vowed to crush the rebels but rejects all claims that it abuses civilians.\n\n“Our soldiers are not allowed to do these kinds of things,” said Nur Abdi Mohammed, a government spokesman. “This is only propaganda and cannot be justified. If a government soldier did this type of thing they would be brought before the courts.”\n\nEven so, the State Department, the European Parliament and many human rights groups, mostly outside Ethiopia, have cited thousands of cases of torture, arbitrary detention and extrajudicial killings — enough to raise questions in Congress about American support of the Ethiopian government.\n\n“This is a country that is abusing its own people and has no respect for democracy,” said Representative Donald M. Payne, Democrat of New Jersey and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa and global health.\n\n“We’ve not only looked the other way but we’ve pushed them to intrude in other sovereign nations,” he added, referring to the satellite images and other strategic help the American military gave Ethiopia in December, when thousands of Ethiopian troops poured into Somalia and overthrew the Islamist leadership.\n\nAccording to Georgette Gagnon, deputy director for the Africa division of Human Rights Watch, Ethiopia is one of the most repressive countries in Africa.\n\n“What the Ethiopian security forces are doing,” she said, “may amount to crimes against humanity.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch issued a report in 2005 that documented a rampage by government troops against members of the Anuak, a minority tribe in western Ethiopia, in which soldiers ransacked homes, beat villagers to death with iron bars and in one case, according to a witness, tied up a prisoner and ran over him with a military truck.\n\nAfter the report came out, the researcher who wrote it was banned by the Ethiopian government from returning to the country. Similarly, three New York Times journalists who visited the Ogaden to cover this story were imprisoned for five days and had all their equipment confiscated before being released without charges.\n\nIn many ways, Ethiopia has a lot going for it these days: new buildings, new roads, low crime and a booming trade in cut flowers and coffee. It is the second most populous country in sub-Saharan Africa, behind Nigeria, with 77 million people.\n\nIts leaders, many whom were once rebels themselves, from a neglected patch of northern Ethiopia, are widely known as some of the savviest officials on the continent. They had promised to let some air into a very stultified political system during the national elections of 2005, which were billed as a milestone on the road to democracy.\n\nInstead, they turned into Ethiopia’s version of Tiananmen Square. With the opposition poised to win a record number of seats in Parliament, the government cracked down brutally, opening fire on demonstrators, rounding up tens of thousands of opposition supporters and students and leveling charges of treason and even attempted to kill top opposition leaders, including the man elected mayor of Addis Ababa.\n\nMany opposition members are now in jail or in exile. The rest seem demoralized.\n\n“There are no real steps toward democracy,” said Merera Gudina, vice president of the United Ethiopian Democratic Forces, a leading opposition party. “No real steps toward opening up space, no real steps toward ending repression.”\n\nEthiopian officials have routinely dismissed such complaints, accusing political protesters of stoking civil unrest and poking their finger into a well-known sore spot. Ethiopia has always had an authoritarian streak. This is a country, after all, where until the 1970s rulers claimed to be direct descendants of King Solomon. It is big, poor, famine-stricken, about half-Christian and half-Muslim, surrounded by hostile enemies and full of heavily armed separatist factions. As one high-ranking Ethiopian official put it, “This country has never been easy to rule.”\n\nThat has certainly been true for the Ogaden desert, a huge, dagger-shaped chunk of territory between the highlands of Ethiopia and the border of Somalia. The people here are mostly ethnic Somalis, and they have been chafing against Ethiopian rule since 1897, when the British ceded their claims to the area.\n\nThe colonial officials did not think the Ogaden was worth much. They saw thorny hills and thirsty people. Even today, it is still like that. What passes for a town is a huddle of bubble-shaped huts, the movable homes of camel-thwacking nomads who somehow survive out here. For roads, picture Tonka truck tracks running through a sandbox. The primary elements in this world are skin and bone and sun and rock. And guns. Loads of them.\n\nCamel herders carry rifles to protect their animals. Young women carry pistols to protect their bodies. And then there is the Ogaden National Liberation Front, the machine-gun-toting rebels fighting for control of this desiccated wasteland.\n\nRebels Live Off the Land\n\nLion. Radio. Fearless. Peacock. Most of the men have nicknames that conceal their real identities. Peacock, who spoke some English, served as a guide. He shared the bitter little plums the soldiers pick from thorn bushes — “Ogaden chocolate,” he called them. He showed the way to gently skim water from the top of a mud puddle to minimize the amount of dirt that ends up in your stomach — even in the rainy season this is all there is to drink.\n\nHe pointed out the anthills, the coming storm clouds, the especially ruthless thorn trees and even a graveyard that stood incongruously in the middle of the desert. The graves — crude pyramids of stones — were from the war in 1977-78, when Somalia tried, disastrously, to pry the Ogaden out of Ethiopia’s hands and lost thousands of men. “It’s up to us now,” Peacock said.\n\nPeacock was typical of the rebels. He was driven by anger. He said Ethiopian soldiers hanged his mother, raped his sister and beat his father. “I know, it’s hard to believe,” he said. “But it’s true.”\n\nHe had the hunch of a broken man and a voice that seemed far too tired for his 28 years. “It’s not that I like living in the bush,” he said. “But I have nowhere else to go.”\n\nThe armed resistance began in 1994, after the Ogaden National Liberation Front, then a political organization, broached the idea of splitting off from Ethiopia. The central government responded by imprisoning Ogadeni leaders, and according to academics and human rights groups, assassinating others. The Ogaden is part of the Somali National Regional State, one of nine ethnic-based states within Ethiopia’s unusual ethnic-based federal system. On paper, all states have the right to secede, if they follow the proper procedures. But it seemed that the government feared that if the Somalis broke away, so too would the Oromos, the Afar and many other ethnic groups pining for a country of their own.\n\nThe Ethiopian government calls the Ogaden rebels terrorists and says they are armed and trained by Eritrea, Ethiopia’s neighbor and bitter enemy. One of the reasons Ethiopia decided to invade Somalia was to prevent the rebels from using it as a base.\n\nThe government blames them for a string of recent bombings and assassinations and says they often single out rival clan members. Ethiopian officials have been pressuring the State Department to add the Ogaden National Liberation Front to its list of designated foreign terrorist organizations. Until recently, American officials refused, saying the rebels had not threatened civilians or American interests.\n\n“But after the oil field attack in April,” said one American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, “we are reassessing that.”\n\nAmerican policy toward Ethiopia seems to be in flux. Administration officials are trying to increase the amount of nonhumanitarian aid to Ethiopia to $481 million next year, from $284 million this year. But key Democrats in Congress, including Mr. Payne, are questioning this, saying that because of Ethiopia’s human rights record, it is time to stop writing the country a blank check.\n\nIn April, European Commission officials began investigating Ethiopia for war crimes in connection to hundreds of Somali civilians killed by Ethiopian troops during heavy fighting in Mogadishu, Somalia’s capital.\n\nWomen Are Suffering the Most\n\nIn the Ogaden, it is not clear how many people are dying. The vast area is essentially a no-go zone for most human rights workers and journalists and where the Ethiopian military, by its own admission, is waging an intense counterinsurgency campaign.\n\nThe violence has been particularly acute against women, villagers said, and many have recently fled.\n\nAsma, 19, who now lives in neighboring Somaliland, said she was stuck in an underground cell for more than six months last year, raped and tortured. “They beat me on the feet and breasts,” she said. She was freed only after her father paid the soldiers ransom, she said, though she did not know how much.\n\nAmbaro, 25, now living in Addis Ababa, said she was gang-raped by five Ethiopian soldiers in January near the town of Fik. She said troops came to her village every night to pluck another young woman.\n\n“I’m in pain now, all over my body,” she said. “ I’m worried that I’ll become crazy because of what happened.”\n\nMany Ogaden villagers said that when they tried to bring up abuses with clan chiefs or local authorities, they were told it was better to keep quiet.\n\nThe rebels said thats was precisely why they attacked the Chinese oil field: to get publicity for their cause and the plight of their region (and to discourage foreign companies from exploiting local resources). According to them, they strike freely in the Ogaden all the time, ambushing military convoys and raiding police stations.\n\nMr. Mohammed, the government spokesman, denied that, saying the rebels “will not confront Ethiopian military forces because they are not well trained.”\n\nExpert or not, they are determined. They march for hours powered by a few handfuls of rice. They travel extremely light, carrying only their guns, two clips of bullets, a grenade and a tarp. They brag about how many Ethiopians they have killed, and every piece of their camouflage, they say, is pulled off dead soldiers. They joke about slaughtering Ethiopian troops the same way they slaughter goats.\n\nTheir morale seems high, especially for men who sleep in the dirt every night. Their throats are constantly dry, but they like to sing.\n\n“A camel is delivering a baby today and the milk of the camel is coming,” goes one campfire song. “Who is the owner of this land?”\n\nWill Connors contributed reporting from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: In Ethiopian Desert, Fear and Cries of Army Brutality.

Both hope to discredit the other, and both hope to emerge from the debate having burnished the public’s view that they are better qualified to be commander in chief.\n\nA roiling disagreement over the role of the debate moderator flared up Sunday, with Democrats arguing that a more activist fact-checker role is needed to rein in Trump’s well-established pattern of factual misstatements.\n\nBut Janet H. Brown, the executive director of the Commission on Presidential Debates, seemed to side with the Republican nominee, saying in a television interview that “it’s not a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopaedia Britannica.” She added, however, that ultimately it will be up to Monday’s moderator, Lester Holt of NBC News, to do the job as he sees fit.\n\nUnderscoring the unique nature of the combatants, Clinton’s debate preparations included a focus on Trump’s personality as well as the substance of what will be discussed onstage at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., according to several Democrats with knowledge of her campaign’s approach.\n\nClinton’s team convened a meeting last month at which longtime aide Philippe Reines, the stand-in for Trump in her mock sessions, deeply studied Trump’s personality to be able to parry with her as Trump might.\n\nThe meeting was one of several during which Clinton aides conferred for hours with outsiders who had been asked to offer advice about Trump’s temperament, according to people familiar with the gathering. The objective was to understand how a man who has spent most of his life in the business world and prides himself on being a dealmaker might behave in a debate setting.\n\nAfter days of preparing for the debate at a hotel near her home in Westchester County, Hillary Clinton departed for Long Island early this afternoon to continue her preparations, according to a campaign aide. She was joined by former president Bill Clinton on the ride over. The campaign plans for the former president to be in the debate hall tonight.\n\nAt Trump Tower in Manhattan, a steady stream of GOP bigwigs and prominent supporters entered the building, where Trump was gathered with his inner circle, according to a person familiar with his activities.\n\nThe stakes Monday could hardly be higher for both candidates. A new Washington Post-poll released Sunday shows likely voters split nationally 46 percent for Clinton and 44 percent for Trump, with Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson at 5 percent and Green Party nominee Jill Stein at 1 percent.\n\n[Poll: Clinton, Trump in virtual dead heat on eve of first debate]\n\nWith barely six weeks remaining until Election Day, Clinton’s camp — after a prolonged focus on trashing Trump — sees the debate as a chance for her to present what she actually hopes to accomplish as president and to ease voters’ deep concerns about her likability and trustworthiness.\n\nFor Trump, his first one-on-one presidential debate offers an opportunity to demonstrate a command of the issues and to persuade voters clamoring for change that he is a credible alternative, his advisers say.\n\nOne of the biggest unknowns remains which Donald Trump will show up. While Clinton has a lengthy record of meticulous preparation and formidable performances, Trump has been more unpredictable. Sometimes, he is the freewheeling showman prone to controversial utterances; other times, with help from his campaign team’s repackaging, he is a more sober and scripted candidate.\n\nThe first of three scheduled debates between Clinton and Trump is likely to have a full agenda. It comes amid heightened fears of terrorism, unrest over police shootings of African American men and a slew of long-standing issues that sharply divide the major-party candidates, including immigration, trade, tax policy and foreign affairs.\n\nIn New York, Trump’s campaign chief executive, Stephen Bannon — carrying a black binder — was seen heading up the gold-tinted elevators, as was Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser, and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nShortly after 10 a.m. Monday, as a group of students lined up at the Starbucks in the Trump Tower lobby, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus entered the building. He said he was going to meet with the nominee and would be with him later at the debate site.\n\nAlso spotted was Linda McMahon, the Connecticut Republican and GOP mega-donor who, along with her husband and wrestling magnate Vince, has known Trump for decades. She planned to attend the debate.\n\nNew York Jets owner Woody Johnson, with a white Jets cap pulled low and a green tie, arrived shortly before noon.\n\nTourists mingled and took pictures next to photos of Ivanka Trump’s jewelry collection as Trump staffers in dark suits walked by. One of them was Bill Russell, 46, of Asheville, N.C., who was with his young daughter.\n\n“It’s a historic day and I wanted to make sure we got a photo of her floating down the famous escalator before we flew home to watch the debate,” Russell said with a chuckle and with Trump just a few floors above him.\n\nOne Trump ally, on the condition of anonymity since they were not authorized to speak, said the campaign has not held any mock debates in recent weeks because of the candidate’s private insistence that he prefers to prepare through wide-ranging conversations with his advisers and friends. Still, the ally said, Trump’s team has conducted extensive research on Clinton, including details on her tendencies and arguments.\n\nSupporters of Clinton and Trump, including their running mates and campaign managers, fanned out across the Sunday television shows to put their spin on the tasks ahead and seek some psychological advantage.\n\nTrump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, seemingly acknowledged on CNN’s “State of the Union” that her candidate was trying “to get into the head of Hillary Clinton” when he suggested Saturday on Twitter that he had invited Gennifer Flowers, who has claimed to have conducted a long-running affair with Bill Clinton, to attend the debate.\n\nTrump’s tweet followed news that rival billionaire Mark Cuban, who supports Clinton, would be sitting in the front row.\n\nTrump’s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, later said categorically on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that Flowers would not be there.\n\nIn their TV appearances, Clinton partisans said she has multiple goals Monday. Those include reminding voters of her long record of championing the interests of children and families and touting her agenda for helping the middle class — but also holding Trump accountable for assertions that independent fact-checkers have labeled false.\n\n“She has a challenge because Donald Trump inveterately says things that aren’t true,” Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “She’s got to be able to make that positive case but also not let Donald Trump get away with what he’s likely to do, which is to make stuff up.”\n\nSen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Clinton’s running mate, said he expects the format to explore the truthfulness of both candidates’ claims.\n\n“There’s a real opportunity to hear somebody say something and then get into whether is that actually true or not,” Kaine said on “Face the Nation.”\n\nTrump’s team continued to press its case Sunday that fact-checking shouldn’t be the responsibility of the moderator, however.\n\n“I really don’t appreciate campaigns thinking it is the job of the media to go and be these virtual fact-checkers and that these debate moderators should somehow do their bidding,” Conway said on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.”\n\nShe also disputed the notion that Trump makes more frequent misstatements, saying Clinton’s “casual relationship with the truth is well-known to Americans.”\n\nFormer House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump supporter, said he believes the moderators should remain a “modest” presence in the debates.\n\n“They’re not running for president,” Gingrich said on “Fox and Friends Sunday.” “It’s pretty stupid to think we’re going to have this third candidate called the moderator, and that they’re going to double-team Donald Trump.”\n\nBrown, the head of the independent debate commission, did not issue a verdict on the controversy during an appearance on CNN’s “Reliable Sources” but said that in the past, the role of the moderator has been to keep things moving and allow the candidates to call one another out for misstatements.\n\nClinton’s camp also continued efforts of recent days to argue that the press and public shouldn’t hold her to a higher standard than Trump because of Clinton’s longer record in public service and more-detailed policy proposals as a candidate.\n\n“I’m very concerned that Donald Trump will be graded on a curve,” Clinton’s campaign manger, Robby Mook, said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Just because he doesn’t fly off the handle in the middle of this debate does not mean that he is prepared to be president of the United States. . . . He needs to roll out specific plans about how he’s going to make life better for Americans.”\n\n[What can we expect from Clinton and Trump in the debate?]\n\nAides to Trump, whose preparations by all accounts have been less meticulous than those of Clinton, are hopeful that the debate will help close what polls have shown to be a credibility gap with Clinton, a former secretary of state, senator from New York and first lady.\n\nClinton’s campaign urged supporters to use Twitter and other social media platforms during the debate to “explain why Trump is unqualified.” An email to select supporters advised debate-watchers to use the hashtag #LoveTrumpsHate “when Trump says something that makes you cringe,” and #I’mWithHer when Clinton “makes you proud.”\n\nAs part of an effort to appear more disciplined in recent weeks, Trump has put an emphasis on new policy proposals, which were sparse during the primary season, and on reining in his freewheeling style at campaign rallies. It remains to be seen whether those efforts will be maintained throughout Monday’s 90 minutes on stage.\n\n“A victory for Donald Trump tomorrow night is answering the questions and showing America that he’s ready to be president and commander in chief on day one,” Conway said on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\nTrump surrogates also sought to raise expectations for Clinton’s performance, talking at length Sunday about her public service while repeatedly stating that Trump has never participated in a one-on-one debate.\n\n“The expectations on Hillary are very, very high,” said the RNC chairman Priebus on “Fox News Sunday.” “She’s been doing this for 30 years. I think people expect her to know every detail. . . . He’s never run before, let alone been in a presidential debate.”\n\nTrump’s biggest challenge might be staying on message, as the episode over Flowers’s possible appearance at the debate demonstrated. Heading into the debate, Trump’s tweet on the subject not only risked distracting from the candidate’s message but could further alienate women voters, with whom Trump has struggled.\n\nOn Sunday, Pence said that the real estate developer was just joking.\n\n“Gennifer Flowers will not be attending the debate tomorrow night,” Pence said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nConway, speaking on CNN, said that Trump has no plans to bring up Bill Clinton’s marital indiscretions during the debate, saying viewers “deserve and expect these candidates to be talking about the issues.”\n\nBut, she added: “I’m not going to reveal what we have been doing in our debate conversations. But the fact is that he has every right to be defend himself.”\n\nClinton aides, meanwhile, argued that the episode was a telling one about Trump.\n\n“You saw his reaction, which is to do his favorite sport, which is to dive in the sewer and go for a swim,” Podesta said on NBC. “He’s kind of predictable: When you poke him a little bit, and he comes back and attacks whoever is doing it.”\n\nRobert Costa in New York and Anne Gearan in Hempstead, N.Y., contributed to this report.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nA roller coaster of a campaign 18 months in the making arrives Monday at a huge moment for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump: a 90-minute debate, with much of the nation expected to tune in amid great uncertainty about what they’ll see.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00014-of-00064--612", "original_text": "Having read Jim Dobson’s latest lecture, I feel a little bit like SpongeBob SquarePants: maligned and misunderstood. But it would be unfair, I think, to suggest that SpongeBob has become bitter over his experience with Jim Dobson; he seems to have moved on.\n\nFrankly, though, I don’t understand why Jim Dobson always feels the need to justify himself in such great detail. If he believes that Dick Armey is the only person who thinks he is a bully, it should be of little concern to him. On some issues, regarding interactions between us, his recollections are clearly different than mine. It seems, therefore, that Jim Dobson is no more willing to believe himself a bully than I am able to believe he is a gentle soul.\n\nFor well over a decade, Dobson and several other self-anointed leaders of America’s Christian evangelicals have cajoled and threatened Republican leaders with public and private ultimatums. As early as 1995, we were being told what bitter disappointments we had turned out to be by Jim Dobson.\n\nTime magazine reports that as early as \"March, James Dobson, head of the powerful Focus on the Family organization, fired off open letters to GOP chairman Haley Barbour, complaining bitterly about the lack of immediate payoff from the November election. Fearful of compromising with 'anti-family' elements, Dobson argued that it was time to fold the all-inviting 'big tent' of the Republican Party.\"\n\nIn 1998, he was quoted in the Washington Times in what became a typical, scolding refrain:\n\n\"Does the Republican Party want our votes, no strings attached — to court us every two years, and then to say, 'Don't call me; I'll call you' — and to not care about the moral law of the universe? ... Is that what they want? Is that the way the system works? Is this the way it's going to be? If it is, I'm gone, and if I go, I will do everything I can to take as many people with me as possible.\"\n\nIn 2004, Dobson told ABC News that he was “quite sure [President Bush] will fail us. He doesn’t dance to our tune. … I think that this President has two years — or more broadly, the Republican party has two years to implement those policies or certainly four, or I believe they’ll pay a price at the — in the next election.”\n\nIn 2005, Dobson and his colleagues even sent a threatening letter to the White House challenging their decision to focus on Social Security reform after the 2004 elections. That letter read in part:\n\n\"We couldn't help but notice the contrast between how the president is approaching the difficult issue of Social Security privatization where the public is deeply divided and the marriage issue where public opinion is overwhelmingly on his side. ... Is [President Bush] prepared to spend significant political capital on privatization but reluctant to devote the same energy to preserving traditional marriage? If so it would create outrage with countless voters who stood with him just a few weeks ago, including an unprecedented number of African-Americans, Latinos and Catholics who broke with tradition and supported the president. ... When the administration adopts a defeatist attitude on an issue that is at the top of our agenda, it becomes impossible for us to unite our movement on an issue such as Social Security privatization where there are already deep misgivings.\"\n\nSo try to understand and forgive my indiscrete use of words over a year ago in an interview, when I used the terms “thugs” and “bully.” My friend Rep. Mike Pence called me out on that, and he was right. And, as much as I never enjoyed Jim Dobson’s many lectures over the years, I too, like SpongeBob, have moved on to the serious issues faced by the conservative movement in America today.\n\nOne of Armey’s Axioms says that if it’s about you, you lose. The idea is always bigger than the man. If this debate becomes merely a Jim Dobson versus Dick Armey circus, it doesn’t help the American public in any way. There is a fundamental debate going on here, one in which neither of us matters all that much.\n\nThe very real tragedy of the past 60 years is the ongoing expansion and intrusion of the federal government into the traditionally private sphere of American life. Activist judges are clearly responsible for much of the damage, but just as corrosive is the expansion of the federal bureaucracy into education, welfare, and health care and retirement. The result is that private, social decisions once left to individuals and communities are now under the control of Washington powerbrokers. Our cultural debate has become politicized.\n\nIn fact, the specific demands constantly made by Dobson and his gang in the name of “values voters” feel a lot like the group identity politics employed by the left wing that every conservative should abhor. The politicization of the culture war cheapens the political participation of millions of Christians by turning us into just another “special interest” group to be appeased by meaningless symbolism.\n\nMeanwhile, the growth of government spending and regulation continues unchecked.\n\nIn his comments posted yesterday, Dobson discussed at length his personal commitment to freedom and limited government. Therefore, we should take him at face value that he is a man dedicated to liberty and small government.\n\nThat being the case, I’m sure he agrees that the action by Congress in the Terri Schiavo situation was a trespass against the separation of powers and an affront to conservatives’ historic resistance to judicial activism and interventionism. Clearly we cannot find judicial activism acceptable in cases when it is ordered by a legislative body. If we do find that acceptable, we might consider the damage that future liberal legislative bodies can wreak. What is good for the goose is good for the gander.\n\nIf Dobson is a champion of freedom, he understands then the risks of using the power of government to define social norms. We might not like what others have to say on these issues when they are in power. If Dobson is a defender of the Constitution, he will pause before calling for amending it on every social issue of the day.\n\nWhen you boil it down, this debate centers on the role of two critical ideas: freedom and righteousness. In our private lives, living righteously is paramount. However, in our public lives — in our relationship with policymakers and our government — we should resist the belief that the power of government should be used to force righteous behavior in others. That’s the temptation facing religious conservatives.\n\nIndeed, such efforts to impose righteousness are doomed to fail — society cannot truly become righteous simply because the government compels “righteous” behavior. God gave us free will, and true righteousness can only be found through a free exercise of personal choice. Although Dobson may not realize it, government-mandated righteousness is a pathway to tyranny.\n\nThe goal for Christians in our public lives, then, must be freedom — freedom to practice our faith without government interference. Freedom to build churches and schools and businesses without being forced to supplicate before an ever-expanding government leviathan.\n\nWhen we defend values, we win; when we impose values, we lose.\n\nJim Dobson is correct that if evangelicals stay home, Republicans lose. On the other hand, equally true, is the fact that if pocketbook voters stay home, we lose (as was the case in 2002, 1998, and in 1992). This election cycle, it is my belief that Americans are more concerned with basic pocketbook issues, and the 109th Congress has failed to address those concerns.\n\nAll officeholders must come to terms with the fact that they are expected to deal with substantive legislative outcomes, not just political posturing and pandering. The electorate holds them accountable.\n\nIndeed, pandering and posturing on gay marriage is an insult to most voters. I’m the first person to argue that marriage is between a man and a woman. But here, Jim Dobson himself is prone to hyperbole, having claimed in one campaign speech that homosexuals and gay marriage “will destroy the earth.” We should leave such rhetoric to Al Gore, where it is better suited.\n\nJim Dobson would have us believe that we, as conservatives and Republicans, face a stark political choice: His way, defeat or nothing. However, a Republican Party that believes its first value is righteousness over freedom is a party that will lose elections.\n\nThere is a better answer than Dobson’s Choice. The Republican Party needs to find a common ground, as President Reagan did, that unites all factions of the GOP coalition. I argue that the common ground is personal liberty and limited government. More fundamentally, freedom is a “tent” in which all Americans, including evangelical Christians, will prosper.\n\nDick Armey, a Republican, represented Texas' 26th Congressional District in the House of Representatives from 1985 to 2003 and was the Majority Leader of the House from 1995 to 2003.\n\nHe is now chairman of FreedomWorks. In his current position, he has traveled to more than 20 states, rallying grassroots, testifying before state and federal governments, meeting with pro-reform legislators, and challenging “backsliding” politicians while helping advance FreedomWorks’ mission of lower taxes, less government and more freedom.\n\nArmey has written four books: \"Price Theory: A Policy-Welfare Approach\" (1977), \"The Freedom Revolution\" (1995), \"The Flat Tax\" (1996), and \"Armey's Axioms\" (2003).", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nHaving read Jim Dobson’s latest lecture, I feel a little bit like SpongeBob SquarePants: maligned and misunderstood.

I look forward to your questions about The Kennedy Legacy and the article in today's Style section about Patrick Kennedy.\n\nRural, Va.: Bobby Kennedy's character transformation from the 50s to the 60s was nothing short of astounding -- moving from a pro-McCarthy stance towards a \"total communication\" concept.\n\nI've often wondered if Eisenhower influenced this change, since Eisenhower firmly believed in dialog as exemplified by his relationship with Prime Minister Khrushchev.\n\nHow close were the Kennedys to Eisenhower?\n\nVincent Bzdek: Bobby's transformation truly was astounding, especially concerning matters of war. He changed a reputation for ruthlessness in political dealings into a compassion for the downtrodden that still endures as his legacy. I think it was really Jack's death that prompted the change, more than his relationship with Eisenhower. After the assassination, Bobby reassessed his approach to politics, and when he no longer had to be the bad cop to his brother's good cop, he let the humanity at his core come to the fore.\n\nBoston: What's left of the Kennedy fortune financially? Have the subsequent generations' pieces of the pie been invested wisely or has it been squandered?\n\nVincent Bzdek: The Kennedy family still has a substantial family fortune, and there were reports in January that Caroline Kennedy herself was worth $100 million. The family's biggest cash cow over the years was Chicago's Merchandise Mart, which they sold in 1998 for $550 million. At one time in the 1930s, Joe Kennedy Sr., Ted's father, was one of the richest men in the country. Of course the family has many more members in it now that share in that fortune, but it's still quite significant.\n\nBoston: What is Ted Kennedy's biggest private regret?\n\nVincent Bzdek: Ted Kennedy once told former Senator Al Simpson of Wyoming that there isn't a day that goes by that he doesn't think about Chappaquiddick, and the loss of Mary Jo Kopechne's life in the accident there. \"It's with me every day,\" he told Simpson just a few years ago.\n\n23224: Since the death of John Jr., and outside of Patrick, is there anyone in the current generation who shows any of the political ambitions of the previous generation? Are we likely to see another Kennedy in the Senate anytime soon?\n\nVincent Bzdek: I really don't think we're likely to see another Kennedy in the Senate soon. There have been some reports that Ted's wife, Vicki, might run for his seat eventually, but she has said nothing publicly. Maria Shriver's son is interested in running for attorney general of California, so the next generation of Kennedys may emerge on the West Coast. But the political machine that got Jack and Ted and Bobby into office no longer exists, as evidenced by Caroline's thwarted attempt to join the Senate. Instead, I think you'll see Kennedys continue the family's public service ethic in other ways, such as Special Olympics, Bobby Kennedy Jr.'s environmental efforts, and Kerry Kennedy's human rights work. I'd also keep an eye on Joe Kennedy's twin sons, Matt and Joe Jr., who are at Harvard now. I met them in Denver and they were both brimming over with Kennedy charisma.\n\nArlington, Va.: Teddy Kennedy is being lauded now as an elder statesman, but it's hard to forget the brushes with the law he's had in the past. What do you think will be/is his true legacy?\n\nVincent Bzdek: Ted Kennedy really did have a checkered private life until he married his current wife, Vicki, in the early 90s. There were speeding tickets, affairs, many many reports of heavy drinking and other reckless behavior. But since he married Vicki, he's turned himself around. And ironically, through all his private ups and downs, he continued to build an unprecedented record of accomplishment in the Senate. I think now that record of accomplishment has far eclipsed his private tribulations. His sins seem to be forgiven -- he was even knighted by the Queen! So I think his legacy will be as one of the greatest Senators in American history, and one of traditional liberalism's most dedicated advocates.\n\nRockville, Md.: What do you see as the driving force behind the enduring sense that the Kennedys are the equivalent of American royalty? How on earth did the secure that position? And do you think the Obamas will wrestle that mantle from them?\n\nVincent Bzdek: When Jack was running for office, the Kennedys held formal, invitation-only parties around Massachusetts that were staged like royal events, complete with a receiving live to meet Joe and Rose Kennedy. Women dressed up in their finest clothes to attend, and often went just to get a glimpse of Jack. The Kennedys tapped into the aspirations of recent Irish immigrants and others who really had come to America to grab onto the American Dream. They all wanted to get where the Kennedys had, and the Kennedys became their gold standard. Joe Sr. was a wizard at publicizing the royal image for his family thanks to his years as a Hollywood producer. Then, after Jack's death, Jackie gave an exclusive interview to a reporter in which she talked extensively about how much Jack had loved the play Camelot, and how he thought of himself in heroic terms. The Camelot label, and the whole idea of a brief, shining moment, stuck.\n\nAlexandria, Va.: Many, many books have been written on the Kennedys. What makes this one different? Also, what did you learn while you were doing your research that truly surprised you?\n\nVincent Bzdek: I think we are in the midst of what Patrick Kennedy described as a poignant \"grand finale\" of the Kennedy's story. I thought that perhaps now was the time to take the full measure of the Kennedy legacy, and look back and try to figure out what it has meant to the country in total. I've looked at the story of the Kennedy borthers -- Joe Jr., Jack, Bobby and Ted -- as one story rather than four, each successive brother striving to fulfill the interrupted promise and finish the unfinished life of the brother before. So in a way, thanks to Ted, there is a final chapter to the Kennedy story that hadn't been told fully, and it's actually a rather happy ending after all the tragedy that has come before. The biggest surpise to me in my research has been how much Ted has accomplished as a Senator, how much of his brothers' dreams he made a reality. It's more than most presidents.\n\nBaltimore, Md.: Can you comment on the close working relationship that Senator Kennedy has had with Orrin Hatch of Utah? If there were ever a political \"odd couple,\" it would be those two.\n\nVincent Bzdek: I interviewed Sen. Hatch for the book and was overwhelmed, frankly, by how fond he is of Ted. Yet when Sen. Hatch first came to Congress, he said \"I came to Washington to fight Ted Kennedy.\" They first began working together closely as members of the labor committee when Ronald Reagan was in office. As chairman, Hatch realized he needed Ted's help to pass anything out of the committee, and Ted realized he needed Hatch's help to preserve some of his programs. They became great friends, sharing a common compassion, I would argue. They wanted to get things done more than fight, so they found common ground on all sorts of issues. They truly put friendship above partisanship. As a result, they teamed up to establish the largest federally-funded program for people with AIDS, they cosponsored a program that gave health insurance to 9 million uninsured kids. And they just partnerd on an enormous new national service program.\n\nBethesda, Md.: Do you think that, had Bobby and Jack lived, they would have had the same impact on popular culture/American history? I ask because they were both fallible human beings, yet this country seemed to treat them both like stars. Do you think that they would have been able to hold onto their shiny patinas if they'd lived through the 70s, 80s, 90s? Or would Jack have had a Bill Clinton-like fall at some point?\n\nVincent Bzdek: I don't think they would have had the same impact. The nostalgia for what Jack and Bobby represented turned them into larger-than-life icons, and surely Jack's affairs and the Kennedy brothers' secret dealings to assassinate Castro and wiretap Martin Luther King, would have leaked out and brought them down to earth. Yet their memories, and that nostalgia, provided the jet fuel for huge accomplishments: landing on the moon, The Civil Rights Act, Vista, the Voting Rights Act, a huge number of social programs we have now. Ironically, their deaths, and what President Johnson, Sargent Shriver, Ted Kennedy and others fought for so that they wouldn't die in vain, may have accomplished more than they would have been able to had they lived.\n\nLegacy: Recently one of President Obama's advisers said that his campaign was the completion of RFK's tragically shortened 1968 Presidential run. I have heard others who saw many of the qualities of RFK and JFK in President Obama, and clearly the endorsement by Sen. Kennedy and his niece Caroline was significant.\n\nVincent Bzdek: The parallels are extraordinary, and I believe that the endorsement by Ted and Caroline was the turning point for Obama's candidacy. It was absolutely crucial, giving him momentum at just the right time. In the late 60s, Bobby Kennedy speculated that it would be 40 years before an Afircan American became president. He was exactly right.\n\nVincent Bzdek: It's time for me to sign off now. Thanks very, very much for all your insightful questions, and taking the time to chat. Wish I could answer them all.\n\nEditor's Note: washingtonpost.com moderators retain editorial control over Discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions. washingtonpost.com is not responsible for any content posted by third parties.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nVincent Bzdek: Hello this is Vincent Bzdek.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00006-of-00064--903", "original_text": "Vuvuzela is a great word, one of the best to enter American popular culture in 2010, though it sounds nothing like an actual vuvuzela. A vuvuzela sounds like a long, droning moan, a sound full of garbage and tennis balls.\n\nThe vuvuzela’s long, plastic barrel provided Americans with the junk shot of sounds this year, the sort of noise you could hear even through a containment dome placed over a gushing underwater oil well owned by BP. (Though if you take a vuvuzela to the airport, you’re going to get an enhanced pat-down, sure as we could be entering a double-dip recession.)\n\nClose your eyes while someone blows a vuvuzela and you can see all this clearly, as if it were playing on a spill-cam over your Web browser at work. Open them and it’s just a World Cup game highlight (speaking of great words: Uruguay vs. Ghana).\n\nAnd the oil kept coming, all summer long, and with it new words — top kill, static kill, bottom kill — that meant failure, until at bottom they didn’t. (There may be put-backs for mortgage bonds. It doesn’t work so well with oil.)\n\nEveryone was glad that the fish kill wasn’t as bad as it might have been. Dispersants may have worked. But the blowout preventer did not.\n\nRefudiate is almost a better word than vuvuzela, because it’s not so much a real word as a neologism, one much of America attributes to Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, who used it in a Twitter message in July. (She took a real shellacking for that.) The Oxford University Press called it the word of the year.\n\nBut refudiate was not Ms. Palin’s word first, even if she unpacked the portmanteau all by her lonesome. David Segal of The New York Times had it in print in late June, in an article about people who sell marijuana for a living. They are not easy to interview.\n\n“Simple yes-or-no questions yield 10-minute soliloquies,” he wrote. “Words are coined on the spot, like ‘refudiate,’ and regular words are used in ways that make sense only in context.”\n\nIt’s like a halfalogue, talking to those guys.\n\nSpeaking of, did you see “Inception”? (Can Ms. Palin refudiate a claim that she took the word refudiate from a sleeping marijuana salesman?) Did you i-dose on Justin Bieber videos (I’m a Belieber!) or contemplate becoming one of the Hollywood star whackers who sent Randy Quaid around a bend and up to Canada to seek asylum? Did you weep along with HungryBear’s double rainbow on YouTube, then seek double rainbows yourself?\n\nMost important of all, did you stand for or against the ground zero mosque near the ground zero Century 21, some blocks away from ground zero itself but almost directly next door to a bar?\n\nG.Z.M. was a big word for 2010, until it was not. On that subject, there was quantitative easing as soon as the midterm elections were over.\n\nThe old and new puns, slang and jargon that we lived with this year. Compiled by Grant Barrett.\n\nbelieber: A fan of Justin Bieber, the Canadian pop singer who also spawned ...\n\nthe Justin Bieber: A haircut also known as the flip and switch, the flow, or the twitch. Now driving parents crazy everywhere.\n\nG.T.L.: For “gym, tan, laundry,” the life philosophy of the Situation, otherwise known as Mike Sorrentino of the reality TV program “Jersey Shore.” You laugh, but it’s worked for him.\n\ni-dosing: A supposed digital drug. Certain soundwaves, the claim goes, give listeners a high. Skeptics abound, watchful parents are everywhere.\n\nstar whacker: The latest in celeb coinage. In October, the actor Randy Quaid and his wife, Evi, begged for asylum in Canada, claiming fear of star whackers, people who had already killed other famous people and were out to get them, too.\n\ncoffice: In South Korea, a coffee shop habitually used as an office by customers, who mooch its space, electricity, Wi-Fi and other resources. Presumably, they pay for the coffee.\n\nhalfalogue: Half of a conversation, like an overheard phone call. The term was coined in the research paper “Overheard Cell-Phone Conversations: When Less Speech is More Distracting” in the journal Psychological Science.\n\nsofalize: A British marketing term created for people who prefer to stay home and communicate with others electronically.\n\nmansplainer: A man compelled to explain or give an opinion about everything — especially to a woman. He speaks, often condescendingly, even if he doesn’t know what he’s talking about or even if it’s none of his business. Old term: a boor.\n\nsocial graph: The structure of personal networks, who people know and how they know them, especially online. The term probably came from the internal lingo at Facebook, but it has spread widely among technology companies.\n\ndemon sheep: The political ad that captured critics everywhere for being “baaad,” as The Wall Street Journal put it. The Senate campaign of Carly Fiorina used and retired the ad, but other campaigns quickly created their own parodies.\n\nmama grizzly: Coined by Sarah Palin, “mama grizzly” is the conservative woman’s battle cry, referring to mothers who ferociously defend their children or policies that benefit them. Often used with humor. In her new book, Ms. Palin wrote that it’s “bear propaganda” to insist that these bears are cute and cuddly.\n\npoutrage: False outrage, usually put on for personal, financial or political gain.\n\nrefudiate: Another Palinism, this time a blend of refute and repudiate. Now used with an eyebrow raised.\n\nshellacking: President Obama’s preferred way to describe what happened to Democrats in the midterm elections. Some might call it a knock-down punch.\n\ncuddle class: Economy-class airplane seats that unfold into a bed or couch, as proposed by Air New Zealand, which calls them “Skycouch” seats.\n\nporno scanner: A full-body security scanner that provoked outrage at airports and on blogs. Also called strip-search scanners and, more politely, by the Transportation Security Administration, advanced imaging technology.\n\nenhanced pat-down: Frisking in which security workers slide the palms of their hands down a person’s body in a search for contraband or weapons.\n\ndouble-dip recession: What economists talked about, and what every Obama administration official feared.\n\nflash crash: The mystery of the financial markets this year: a May 6 market drop of almost 1,000 points.\n\npeak water: Like “peak oil,” a theory that humans may have used the water easiest to obtain, and that scarcity may be on the rise.\n\nQE2: Not the ocean liner, but the abbreviation for the Fed’s latest round of quantitative easing, its purchase of Treasury bonds. The term is usually used by critics derisively, and often in combination with another disaster, the sinking of the Titanic.\n\nrobo-signer and put-back: Even for people who never read their mortgage documents, these terms became inescapable as the foreclosure crisis hit. For the record, a robo-signer approves mortgage foreclosure notices without verifying its contents. A put-back is a mortgage sold back to an institutional seller because of problems with documentation.\n\ncontainment dome: After the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon, everyone became an engineer. The containment dome? Yes, that seals the leak.\n\njunk shot: Plugging the leak with old tires, golf balls and other debris.\n\nstatic kill: Sealing the well by pumping in a synthetic mud from the top.\n\nbottom kill: The same technique, only many thousands of feet further down the well through a relief well. How we got this education: the 24-hour spillcam that broadcast the leak.\n\ninception: Popularized by the movie “Inception,” the word expanded from its usual meaning and now refers to ideas planted in the dreams of other people.\n\ndouble rainbow: A phrase from the hugely popular YouTube video by Paul Vasquez, featuring his breathless amazement at the sight of two rainbows at Yosemite National Park. It spawned parodies, television commercials, dance mixes, Auto-Tune versions, parties and Halloween costumes, and is now used to refer — ironically and not — to something amazing.\n\nE.V.: An electric vehicle. While the term has been around for decades, there are now more cars like the Nissan Leaf and the Chevy Volt, which makes it more than an environmentalist’s pipeless dream.\n\nG.Z.M.: An acronym for ground zero mosque — the shorthand term for a controversial Muslim community center proposed near the site where the World Trade Center was attacked.\n\nvuvuzela: The South African plastic trumpet that invaded, like locusts, the World Cup matches in Johannesburg. Television viewers, as well as participants, couldn’t escape the buzzzzz.\n\nWeird: Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic, an acronym and criticism of the typical subjects in studies by behavioral scientists. That is, they tend to be the easiest to recruit: undergraduates.\n\nGrant Barrett is a lexicographer specializing in slang and new words.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00003-of-00064--271", "original_text": "Outside, snow blankets the steep rooftops and ice seals the pond. Inside, by the red glow of the hearth, faces flushed with beer debate the meaning of the scriptures and the rights of the king. And then horses' hooves are heard thundering into the frozen village square, above the yells of soldiers.\n\nThat's how I picture the moment before Pieter Bruegel's painting The Massacre of the Innocents. In Bruegel's snowscape, a village is being turned upside down by soldiers who have come on behalf of Philip II, king of Spain, to punish heresy, to show what happens when provinces revolt. The armoured horsemen are a tight, compressed mass, black against white snow; they wait in patient menace while footsoldiers with pikes and battering rams bash in the doors of houses and drag villagers into the main square. They are violently investigating souls. Women sit weeping in the snow. A man is on his knees, begging mercy from the finely clothed officers on their horses, who seem amused by it all.\n\nAt some point in the past, the infants in this painting in the Royal Collection, on view at Hampton Court, being thrown about, slaughtered, mourned by screaming mothers, were replaced by packages and animals - a transformation that makes the hidden meaning of the picture manifest. The owner, who was so shocked by Bruegel's realistic violence that he asked for the \"innocents\" to be concealed, accidentally exposed what this painting is really about: the sack of a village during Spain's violent repression of Protestant Netherlandish rebellion in the late 16th century.\n\nBruegel's Massacre is a picture whose authority everyone recognises, a chilling complement to his lovely winter landscape The Hunters in the Snow. The homeliness of the hunters' world is overturned in the Massacre by death battering at the door. Death was doing this regularly in Bruegel's southern Netherlands in the late 1560s, as the beginnings of the Dutch revolt against Catholic rule provoked vicious repression. In 1565, despite the urging of local nobles for moderation, Philip II reaffirmed the death penalty for heresy among his Netherlands subjects; in 1566 there were Calvinist riots; in 1567 the Duke of Alba was sent with an army to try to crush dissent for good, resulting in one of the cruellest military campaigns in European history.\n\nIn the Prado in Madrid, you can compare Bruegel's works with the paintings that influenced him and shaped his idea of what art might be: the delirious phantasms of Hieronymous Bosch. It's a train of thought also pursued by the National Gallery's new show, Bosch and Bruegel: Inventions, Enigmas and Variations.\n\nBruegel was obsessed with Bosch, painter of The Garden of Earthly Delights and the genius of Flemish Renaissance art. Bosch was hugely popular; Bruegel was the only artist who could recapture his folly, delusion and delight - Bosch's painterly heir. But he made some alterations to the lunatic tower he inherited.\n\nHieronymous Bosch lived in 's-Hertogenbosch, near Antwerp; he was born in about 1450 and died in 1516. He was far and away the most brilliant genius of northern Renaissance art, a mind of incomparable imaginative freedom. Bosch's paintings are full of giant birds, buildings like kidneys and livers with saws stuck through them, severed ears, bubble-houses, giraffes, Jesus and all the rest. He paints an unreality dredged from the depths of the late medieval mind. He imagines underworlds; he also invents utopias. Thomas More, his contemporary, claimed it was in Antwerp that he met the sailor who told him about Utopia, the account of the far-off island society he wrote in 1516, the year Bosch died.\n\nBosch's countryman Erasmus of Rotterdam, the intellectual leader of the northern Renaissance, argued in his book Praise of Folly in 1509 that foolishness, ugliness, hilarity have a place in life, perhaps even in religion. Thinking of that kind, as well as the magnetism of his images (which has never faded), helps to explain why Bosch became so sought after in 16th-century Europe. If he fascinated Bruegel, he also preoccupied Philip II of Spain, architect of the Netherlands' misery, who owned Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights and the Haywain, and who contemplated their conundrums in the shadows of his monastic palace, the Escorial.\n\nBruegel was born in 1525 and worked in Antwerp and Brussels, dying in 1569. His career was founded on wild, symbolic, dreamlike images that reminded people of Bosch. And yet it is the ways in which he departs from Bosch that make him great.\n\nBosch is the prisoner of his fantasies. There is a traumatic painting by him in the Prado of the Temptations of St Anthony; you can't help seeing this image of a mind beset by freakishness and chaos as autobiographical. The same sense of being surrounded by demons makes Bosch's Christ Mocked, in the National Gallery, quite terrifying. This group, with a human Christ surrounded by inhuman grotesques, closely resembles a famous drawing by Leonardo da Vinci (coincidentally - they never met) of a wise man fallen among gross idiots that can be interpreted as a melancholy self-portrait. Maybe Bosch's painting is also a self-portrait, of a man tortured by hideous phantoms.\n\nBruegel is more down-to-earth - and far less personal. He was more in the world than his predecessor. Bruegel travelled to Italy, and intimations of Italian art and architecture crop up in his paintings in the least likely places. His Tower of Babel, a prodigious termite city crumbling upwards, has enormous internal buttresses based on the ones he saw in the shell of the Colosseum in Rome.\n\nHe lived in interesting times. Outside the Netherlands, the brutality of those days is forgotten; yet Bruegel's images of war, from Dulle Griet (which inspired Brecht's Mother Courage) to The Suicide of Saul (whose swarming army returns in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films) live on. When we see Bruegel's Massacre of the Innocents, we know we are glimpsing something with emotional and reporterly truth, even though the red faces of the soldiers are bulbous caricatures and the stocky bodies of the peasant women are grey cartoons against the snow. Bruegel's allure lies exactly in this tension between fantasy and history. The reason his works are unforgettable is that, in their wild fantastic excess, they strike us as real. Especially when he pictures the end of the world.\n\nIn about 1560, Bruegel painted a scene from the ultimate war. The Triumph of Death is unmistakably a war painting, a history painting. In a panoramic landscape, Death's army rages, innumerable, invincible. Thousands of skeletons mass behind coffin-shields under Death's banners. As a skeleton beats the war drums, they deploy new technologies including a giant box raised by a lever into which men and women are savagely shoved. Some humans fight back, but these isolated acts of courage have no significance.\n\nAnother army of death approaches in a bony column; people are executed on the hilltops by skeletons swinging mighty swords, their bodies displayed on circular raised platforms. There are ships burning in the distance, a red glow of horror beyond the horizon: evidently, the same terrible scenes are taking place everywhere in the world.\n\nIt's impossible to miss the taste of history in this picture. The unstoppable army of skeletons has something acutely satirical about it; this is what war is like. In its very fantasy and excess, Bruegel's painting reveals truths never officially acknowledged about the way the world is.\n\nBruegel is a realist - even a social realist. This is why his art appealed to 20th-century socialist and communist writers such as WH Auden and Bertolt Brecht. He takes the mad, foolish, impossible fantastic realm mapped by Bosch and demonstrates, with brutal peasant humour, that it is not so far after all from the everyday cruelties and injustices and stupidities we accept as natural. Bosch was not mad, Bruegel says - he was a prophet. You do not need to close your eyes to see monstrosities. They are all around us.\n\nIn 1557 Bruegel engraved a print called Big Fish Eat Little Ones. It was successfully marketed as a work by Bosch, but it's more pointed than anything Bosch would have done. The spectacle of a giant fish dragged onto the shore, spewing dozens of smaller fish out of its gawping mouth while men slice open its belly to reveal even more fishlings, has all the power of Bosch - but is far easier to read. Bosch's paintings have never been convincingly deciphered. Bruegel's print is immediately understandable: it's a savage moral satire, a bleak economic truth. Big fish eat little ones, the rich eat the poor. The parable still works. I have a paperback about global capitalism somewhere with Bruegel's image on the cover.\n\nEven in their different versions of The Adoration of the Magi, at the heart of the National Gallery's exhibition, the contrast between Bosch and his follower is telling. Bosch's Adoration of the Magi (the National is exhibiting a studio copy of the Prado original) has a stunning background of science-fiction architecture: the round skyscrapers, tubular towers and pyramid-spires of Bosch's Bethlehem look like they came off the cover of a 1970sAsimov paperback - or failing that, out of Stalin's Moscow. These buildings have no precedent or classical model; they are glimpses of utopia that make it hard to pay attention to the miraculous birth in the foreground.\n\nBruegel, however, shifts our attention precisely to the tough realities of the stable scene. The withered flesh of the Magi makes them an unimpressive bunch, and they have come to see the infant Christ accompanied by a large armed guard. Soldiers press towards the stable, their vicious-bladed pikes closing the sky, a military presence as jarring and sinister as the death squad in The Massacre of the Innocents.\n\nMoney, war, religion - the insanities that disorder Bruegel's world are all too recognisable. Bosch is an architect of the unreal, Bruegel a historian of the horrors we know.\n\n· Bosch and Bruegel is at the National Gallery, London WC2, from January 24 until April 4.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00008-of-00064--769", "original_text": "Sam Allardyce's position might not be quite as endangered as Alex Ferguson's before that famous FA Cup third-round tie at Nottingham Forest in January 1990 but there is also some fairly hard evidence that West Ham United's manager is at a point in his professional life when he desperately needs his own Mark Robins moment.\n\nTwenty-four years ago, it was a 1-0 win at the City Ground that ensured Ferguson kept his job, on a day when Manchester United supporters clambered three-quarters of the way up one of the floodlights and perched on top of the scoreboard, looking only slightly less precarious than the workmen lunching on that exposed girder of the Rockefeller Center.\n\nNow it is Allardyce's turn, facing a team from the Championship's playoff positions and maybe harbouring a few job worries of his own at a time when West Ham are in the Premier League's relegation places and increasingly looking vulnerable to being sucked into the plughole. At one point earlier in the week, bookmakers had stopped the market on Allardyce being the next manager to lose his employment.\n\nWest Ham's next assignment is the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi‑final at Manchester City and then a Premier League trip to fourth-bottom Cardiff City for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first home match since Vincent Tan prised him away from Moldeprised him away from Molde. That, arguably, is the biggest occasion of a significant week given the priorities of Premier League life. Another bad result and nobody should be particularly shocked, modern football being what it is, if Allardyce becomes the next casualty of his trade.\n\nForgive me if that sounds horribly like scaremongering but unfortunately it is just the nature of the business these days, bearing in mind that almost half the 92 clubs in England have brought in new managers since the end of last season, including all the clubs keeping West Ham company in the bottom five. It is a harsh, unforgiving industry and it would be naive to think Allardyce is free of risk when West Ham move into the Olympic Stadium in 2016 and have based all their planning on making the switch as a Premier League club.\n\nThere will be 54,000 seats to fill, for starters. New fans have to be found and won over and, with Canary Wharf a few stops down on the Jubilee line, a large part of that process is about filling the corporate areas. Just consider how much easier that would be if the derbies were against Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal, rather than Charlton, Millwall and Watford. Or how many empty seats there might be against, say, Yeovil or Blackpool. In the circumstances, West Ham are entitled to be fretful.\n\nThat is not to say it is ever easy second-guessing what goes on behind the scenes at Upton Park. The memory still lingers, for example, of the club's last relegation season in 2011, when nobody from their board could even be bothered to make the trip to Manchester City in the first week of May, on the basis they were bottom of the league and had already decided there was no chance of getting a result. Nobody had rung ahead either, so a table was prepared in the boardroom for David Gold, David Sullivan and their entourage without a single piece of bread ever being broken. The score was 2-1 to City, but that's not really the point.\n\nA small thing, perhaps, but maybe this is also an appropriate time to ask whether there is there any other club in the world where the greatest source of information into transfer dealings and internal business is the daily tweeting of an owner's 13-year-old son. The personal highlight of Jack Sullivan's operation so far – or @jsullivanwhu: \"I am David Sullivan's son, and I give you the top West Ham news!\" – has to be his apology to his growing following, currently just short of 35,000, when Marouane Chamakh arrived from Arsenal this time last year. Or to quote him directly: \"I am very sorry about this news Chamakh has sign a 6 month loan deal! no my pick.\"\n\nThe latest offering was to announce the club suspected Newcastle had gazumped them in a deal for John Heitinga, sparking all sorts of media calls to St James' Park before an admission later on that it was not the case after all. The \"lol\" generation on Twitter may not see the problem but if West Ham want to be taken seriously it is probably time the old man confiscated the laptop.\n\nThe bigger picture is that the stakes are so extraordinarily high for West Ham their manager surely cannot be surprised that he suddenly looks so vulnerable. At Blackburn Rovers, Allardyce used to say keeping the club in the Premier League meant 45% of their workforce staying in their jobs. Yet the financial risks are even higher these days. Bolton Wanderers may be an extreme example but, equally, there is no point overlooking the way they have been financially shipwrecked by losing their top-flight status. Even by the sport's modern standards, there is something particularly ghastly about a club of their size having a debt of £163ma debt of £163m, haemorrhaging cash at such a rate one has to wonder where it will all end.\n\nIn Allardyce's case, he is experiencing what happens when a manager wins promotion, keeps the momentum going the next season and then finds it difficult to maintain the upward trajectory. There is an irony here, too, because if you were looking for a manager with the necessary skills to scrap out the sufficient number of points in a relegation dogfight, he ticks an awful lot of the boxes. The same applies if West Ham go down and will need a manager who knows a thing or two about what it takes to get out of the Championship. A reasonable case could be made they already have that man in place.\n\nIt is also true, however, that sometimes a manager can get stuck in a rut. West Ham won their first home game of the season on 17 August and thereafter have managed it in the league only one more time. A significant number of supporters are close to mutiny and, however much Allardyce cites injuries, there is more to West Ham's current predicament than just misfortune. Poor planning has a lot to do with it, for starters. No manager in this division should risk going into the season with only one senior striker, and it was another shortsighted gamble thinking they could get away with having three centre-halves. As it has turned out, Andy Carroll has not played a single minute in a team that appears to be built exclusively around his style, and West Ham currently have a variety of different odd-job men trying to muddle through in the centre of defence.\n\nIn May, Allardyce decided Carlton Cole was not good enough to get a new contract and should be moved out; in October, the same player was still looking for a new club and was brought back on a short-term dealwas brought back on a short-term deal. Cole has actually acquitted himself pretty well, in trying circumstances, but it strays very close to being an act of desperation.\n\nKevin Nolan's recent transgressions smack of a player who is struggling to cope with his diminished abilities and the club's dithering over offering Ravel Morrison a new contract is another mystery now his transfer value, with 18 months left on his current deal, is starting to depreciate and there are potential buyers circling. Morrison really should be the kind of player West Ham want to use to bring crowds to their new stadium.\n\nAllardyce is now talking about filling his team against Forest with youngsters, partly because of the club's injury list but also in keeping with what Paul Lambert has had to say over the past few days about where the FA Cup ranks these days.\n\nNobody should be too surprised, either, if Allardyce's team selection against Manchester City at the Etihad on Tuesday is geared towards what happens in Cardiff the following Saturday and trying to avoid, in newspaper terms, becoming the recipient of the first \"Another Fine Mess\" headline of the Tan and Ole era. A club with West Ham's ambitions have to be jumpy.\n\nOn FA Cup third-round weekend, maybe this is a good time to ask whether the Football Association could possibly find it within themselves to start taking a little bit more care of their own competition.\n\nA smallish thing, perhaps, but for starters it is not terribly impressive that the draw for the fourth round – in keeping with what seems to be the norm these days – will take place on Sunday before five of the games have even kicked off or finished.\n\nAt least the final has been moved back to the last weekend of the season rather than being shoehorned in between whatever is on in the Premier League, but it still grates that the FA will not even contemplate whether it would be better to have the semi-finals away from Wembley when, year on year, there is considerable evidence that it takes away from the main event.\n\nUnfortunately, it won't change, as became clear the last time a group of us journalists, all in our 30s or older, put it to the relevant people. \"People of our generation and older all remember semi-finals being played at neutral grounds up and down the country,\" Adrian Bevington, the managing director of Club England, told us. \"The younger fans have a different mind‑set, that's the reality of it. The FA Cup is a very different competition to what we remember in the 1970s and 1980s. It has a different place in the football genre now.\"\n\nBut that's the point, surely. Different does not actually mean being any better. Or is this an age that likes Budweiser-sponsored ribbons on the trophy or, thinking back to last season, an operatic version of Abide With Me that could actually drive you to buying a pint of the stuff?\n\nThat really was an embarrassing little sketch from Southampton to report Mark Clattenburgto report Mark Clattenburg to his bosses and insist he is taken off their games because the referee had apparently responded to a mouthful of abuse from Adam Lallana with a mild put‑down of his own.\n\nAt first, the only natural conclusion to draw was that Clattenburg must have had a loss of self-control and sworn at the player. Instead, it turns out he was responsible for saying to Lallana: \"You are very different now, since you played for England, you never used to be like this.\" Shocking stuff, I'm sure everyone would agree.\n\nIn other news, the Southampton striker Dani Osvaldo has just been banned for three matches and fined £40,000 because of the flare-up at Newcastle that also led to a member of Mauricio Pochettino's backroom staff, Toni Jiménez, being banished to the stands. Funnily enough, not a word from St Mary's about that.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nSam Allardyce's position might not be quite as endangered as Alex Ferguson's before that famous FA Cup third-round tie at Nottingham Forest in January 1990 but there is also some fairly hard evidence that West Ham United's manager is at a point in his professional life when he desperately needs his own Mark"}
{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00013-of-00064--439", "original_text": "Dr. John Redd, a captain in the U.S. Public Health Service, was sent in September by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to Sierra Leone, one of the three West African countries most devastated by the Ebola epidemic. The 52-year-old was assigned to Makeni, the capital of the northern district of Bombali (pop. 434,000). After six weeks battling the deadly disease, Redd returned to his home in Santa Fe, N.M., where he described his experience to Time Inc. senior editorial adviser Richard B. Stolley.\n\nTHE ROLE OF CDC DOCTORS DEPLOYED TO FIGHT EBOLA IS NOT PATIENT CARE. WHY?\n\nI am a medical epidemiologist, and epidemiologists control disease at a population level. I volunteered to go to Sierra Leone with CDC to help control the outbreak and support local efforts to slow it down.\n\nWASN’T IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU NOT TO TREAT PATIENTS?\n\nI was treating patients, but not one at a time. That’s public health. I was supporting the system of outbreak control so that there will ultimately be fewer patients to treat.\n\nTo slow down the spread and reduce transmission, because that’s what really controls an outbreak like Ebola. It’s the public health measures that will end the outbreak, not treatment, as important as treatment is.\n\nFirst is case identification or case finding. That means helping local authorities find people in the community as early as possible who have the disease or may have it, moving them into holding centers so they are removed from their community while their labs are pending, and then sending patients who are positive to an ETU, Ebola Treatment Unit. That’s where personnel from Doctors Without Borders, the International Red Cross and other aid organizations work – the part of the Ebola system most people are familiar with.\n\nWHAT WAS THE LOCAL MEDICAL INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE?\n\nThough extremely under-resourced by American standards, there is an existing public health surveillance system, just as in the U.S., where we have systems to count cases of diseases like influenza. In Sierra Leone, it had been used for diseases other than Ebola, like malaria and typhoid fever. The country also has an existing clinical medical system, which starts with very small health stations in many villages. In my district there were more than 100 of those, leading all the way to the government hospital in Makeni.\n\nWHAT WAS THE EBOLA SITUATION WHILE YOU WERE THERE?\n\nWe investigated more than 800 patients with suspected Ebola, and more than half were confirmed with the disease. There were over 100 deaths, but that is probably an underestimate. There’s a delay in reporting deaths from ETUs, and some deaths in rural areas are not reported. By the time I left, the numbers in our district had begun to decrease. But in -areas around Freetown—the capital of Sierra Leone—cases are still on the rise.\n\nWHAT WAS YOUR FIRST CONTACT WITH A PERSON WITH EBOLA?\n\nI saw my first patient the day after I arrived, through a window in a holding center in Makeni. We could not go inside. We had three holding centers with a total of 140 beds, with a physical gradation according to patient risk. In the middle of each center were confirmed patients waiting transit to an ETU in another district. They were vomiting, had diarrhea and were very weak. Anyone who treated those patients, mainly nurses from Sierra Leone, needed to be in full protective gear in spite of the heat – near 100ºF – and high humidity. Those nurses were incredibly heroic. There was another section for patients waiting for blood test results, and a third for patients being observed for 21 days after their tests turned out negative. This separation of patients, and the nursing procedures, were all designed to minimize the risk that someone who was negative could get the disease there.\n\nWHEN DID YOU WITNESS YOUR FIRST EBOLA DEATH?\n\nIt was the same morning. As many as eight people were dying some days.\n\nHOW DID THE SURVEILLANCE PROCESS WORK?\n\nWe had about 100 college and public health students from Sierra Leone, mostly men, some women, whose classes had been cancelled because of Ebola. For now, school isn’t happening in Sierra Leone. They were the team’s disease detectives. Every morning they would ride their motor bikes out to respond to alerts that a household member was ill or had died. They would call an ambulance to remove the body or take the patient to a holding center. We had only four ambulances, so sometimes we would have to ask patients to walk to the holding center. We had to be very practical about it. Then the surveillance officer would talk to the family about who might have come in contact with the patient. These contacts would be followed for 21 days.\n\nWHERE WERE THESE FAMILIES LOCATED?\n\nMostly in the south of the district, around Makeni. But some were in villages in the rural north. Many did not have electricity, and most did not have running water or flush plumbing. Unfortunately these conditions are conducive to the transmission of Ebola.\n\nTHESE INVESTIGATORS WERE GOING HOUSE TO HOUSE AND LITERALLY KNOCKING ON DOORS?\n\nYOU SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN CLOSE TO THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE. HAVE YOU STAYED IN TOUCH?\n\nYes, especially with a med student named Francis Abu Bayor. We worked side by side over there, and we’ve been emailing since. He was the leader of the surveillance team and in charge of our database on all the patients. He was an absolute optimist. His phrase was “challenge.” He would say, “Dr. John, we have a challenge” and that could mean anything from a new Ebola outbreak in a previously unaffected neighborhood to the printer being out of paper. Everything was just a challenge to be overcome.\n\nHe’s waiting for medical school to reopen. On my last day there, we gave him a stethoscope, which is traditional in medicine. My parents gave me one when I graduated from med school. Getting hold of a stethoscope was pretty convoluted. I ordered it from Amazon.com and had it delivered to a doctor in Atlanta who was coming to Sierra Leone. When he arrived in Freetown, he gave it to another doctor who was staying in my hotel. Then the three of us who had worked with Francis — Brigette Gleason, Tiffany Walker and I — presented it to him. He told me he was so inspired by his connection with CDC that he was going to make his career in public health.\n\nWHAT WERE OTHER OBSTACLES YOU HAD TO OVERCOME?\n\nFuel was a constant problem because the investigators had to travel so far. So I put in a request to the CDC Foundation for fuel money, and it was granted. One of my jobs most afternoons was to take those fuel vouchers to the gas station and fill up the vehicles that were transporting the blood samples. And sometimes I’d fill up the investigators’ motor bikes as well.\n\nWAS A SICK PERSON EVER RELUCTANT TO GO TO THE HOLDING CENTER?\n\nSometimes, at first. I helped in a few cases. We would talk to the head of the household and to the chief of the village. And we talked to the sick person, of course. To make sure I myself was not exposed to Ebola, I never passed over the threshold of a house. I’d ask the person to come out and we would talk from a distance in the street, usually a dirt path or road. Nobody was taken against their will, and I never saw anyone refuse to go. People were quite aware of Ebola because the education they had received had been very effective.\n\nHOW DID FAMILIES REACT WHEN THIS HAPPENED?\n\nIt could be tragic. In some cases, it was the last time they ever saw their loved one. They would say goodbye in the house, and because they were contacts, they would have to remain there and be monitored for Ebola. Getting information on that patient in the holding center could be very difficult, though the surveillance officers tried. If the person turned out to be positive, he or she would be taken away to a distant treatment unit, where sometimes they died. Those were some very touching situations.\n\nONCE IN THE HOLDING CENTER, WHAT HAPPENED?\n\nPatients with possible Ebola would receive medications for malaria and typhoid fever, intravenous fluids and also oral rehydration solution, which contains water, sugar and salt. And the blood draw would go as quickly as possible. That had to be done in full protective equipment. It’s quite a heroic job for someone to be drawing blood on Ebola patients all day long. Their dedication is hard to imagine. I was there 42 days, which I found very challenging, physically, mentally and emotionally. But the local health workers have been working like that for months.\n\nHOW WERE THE BLOOD SAMPLES TESTED?\n\nThey had to be driven four to five hours to a CDC run lab in a town called Bo, which would email or telephone me the results. We had more than 800 samples sent for testing while I was there, and our goal was to have no more than 48 hours between someone’s lab test and learning whether they were positive or negative. It’s below 48 hours now, which considering the logistics is a real victory.\n\nThere were many days when I would go to the holding centers to deliver blood test results to the nurses and help with the disposition of patients. If positive, we would get that person to a treatment center as quickly as possible, but it was three to four hours away. We, the lab and the treatment center were all in different locations. One way to conceptualize this is to imagine someone is suspected of Ebola in Dallas, has to be taken to Fort Worth to draw blood, then the blood is driven to Wichita, Kans., and if positive, the patient is transported from Fort Worth to Little Rock, Ark., for treatment. That is based on the actual drive times in Bombali.\n\nMostly dirt. It was the end of the rainy season, which meant that they were often mud. The vehicle carrying the lab samples crashed twice in one week because of road conditions. One of the scariest moments for me was hearing about those two accidents. I worried that there were unsecured blood samples at the site, but they were packed in a strong puncture-resistant container, and the samples were fine and were tested normally.\n\nWHAT WAS THE CDC PRESENCE IN YOUR DISTRICT?\n\nAbout 60 CDC personnel were in Sierra Leone at any one time, and we had seven staying in Makeni and working in Bombali and the adjacent district, Tonkolili. Six were doctors or epidemiologists, and one was a communications specialist because a vast part of outbreak control is educating people. We all stayed in the same hotel, and often ate breakfast and dinner together. Lunch was a PowerBar at our desks. Most everybody worked until midnight or 1 a.m., but one evening we all got together to relax and watch a movie I had on my laptop —Die Hard—and some of the hotel employees watched too. It was a nice diversion. I felt extremely close to the CDC colleagues I was working with.\n\nFour or five times a week, I got on the elliptical at the hotel for an hour at the end of the day. It didn’t plug into the wall, didn’t need electricity. So when the power went out, which happened frequently, I kept going in the dark. The other people in the gym would laugh, but exercise is very important to me, both at home and traveling. When the lights were on, I was on my BlackBerry most of the time on the elliptical. That was routine multi-tasking.\n\nHOW DID YOU PROTECT YOURSELF FROM EBOLA?\n\nThe most important thing was no touching. No shaking hands, no hugging. It was a massive societal change. I’d never been to Sierra Leone before, but I’d heard that the people are affectionate and physical. It was really something to live in that reality where you never touch another person — except a couple of times when I inadvertently bumped into someone at a meeting. Also, before being posted, we were trained at CDC in Atlanta in the use of personal protective equipment which all of us carried in backpacks at all times. Fortunately I never needed to put mine on.\n\nDID YOU EVER GET SICK OVER THERE?\n\nI got mild food poisoning after a weekend trip to CDC headquarters in Freetown. At first, I didn’t know what it was, but I followed all our established procedures. I isolated myself in my hotel room for 24 hours. We had a supply of MREs [meals ready to eat] so I didn’t have to leave. I checked my temperature and reported it to my supervisor so a decision could be made as to how to handle it, depending upon the symptoms, and if needed, discussions with Atlanta. My symptoms went away quickly, and I never had a fever. It wasn’t Ebola.\n\nEvery person who died, no matter what the circumstances were, was supposed to be tested for Ebola with a cheek swab and then buried safely. The body was quickly placed in a body bag, which was sprayed with chlorine by a protected burial team. Then it was taken to a new and separate communal cemetery especially set aside for this purpose. To the burial teams’ great credit, they were extremely respectful. Families could not say goodbye at a funeral and could not be at the burial, but could wait nearby. And after the ground was also sprayed with disinfectant, loved ones could leave small memorials and markers there. Seeing that cemetery was one of the most moving experiences of my entire life.\n\nTHESE WERE HIGHLY EMOTIONAL MOMENTS. DID YOU EVER FIND YOURSELF IN TEARS?\n\nI did cry a couple of times, but only in the evenings at the hotel, not in public. I think most of the CDC workers cried at one time or another. All of the CDC people supported one another a great deal, because everyone realized how stressful it was. So I never felt alone. I felt emotional very frequently, and tears were close, but the days were so busy and long that I was able for the most part to keep my attention on the matters at hand.\n\nDID YOU FINALLY GET ACCUSTOMED TO THE DANGER?\n\nI never felt personally threatened, but of course my risk was not zero. To keep it at zero, I would have had to stay home. We were all accepting some level of risk. But it was more the constant psychological cost of having to worry about it, of never touching people, maintaining distance, having to stay disconnected from potential patients. It was like a blanket over all our activities. On a human level, it was very difficult, many hours a day, seven days a week, and it was frequently very sad.\n\nWHAT WAS THE FEELING ABOUT AMERICANS THERE?\n\nI didn’t feel a negative vibe even once. People said thank you routinely. It was really touching. When I spoke to the young men and women we were working with, I would emphasize that we were brothers and sisters in the fight against Ebola. We were all on the same team. I think that’s the way everyone felt.\n\nHOW DID YOUR OWN FAMILY FEEL ABOUT YOUR ASSIGNMENT?\n\nThey were very supportive. My wife, Bernie, actually encouraged me to go to Sierra Leone. She is a physician herself and understood both the gravity of the situation and the contribution I could make to it. Most deployments are for 29 days, and when the CDC asked me to stay longer, she said it sounded like a good idea. We kept in touch mostly by email, but I bought a local phone card and we talked a couple times each week. The connection wasn’t bad. I was able to see my daughters at college on Skype from time to time. It helped that they didn’t seem worried. When we talked or e-mailed, I tended to emphasize the positive aspects of what we were doing and minimized the sad things I’d seen.\n\nNOW THAT YOU’RE BACK HOME, ARE YOU IN QUARANTINE?\n\nTechnically, I was not. I was in a category that’s called low risk, but not zero risk for 21 days. I had to report on my temperatures twice a day to both the state of New Mexico and CDC. I wasn’t supposed to go to work, but Sandia National Laboratories was very supportive and understanding. I am detailed there by CDC as an epidemiologist on their International Biological Threat Reduction team. I could leave home briefly to buy food or something like that, but my wife was happy to take care of those things. I was told to report any illness or symptoms immediately. It ended November 19, and I’m fine.\n\nWHAT DID YOU LEARN IN SIERRA LEONE?\n\nAs a physician, I learned how quickly someone can get terribly sick from Ebola and die. As a medical epidemiologist, I saw that the public health efforts to which CDC is contributing are going to be what eventually ends this outbreak. As a human being, I learned how hard working, brave and heroic my Sierra Leonean colleagues were. At no time did I feel that what I was doing was futile. Ultimately, what I really learned about Ebola is that it is controllable.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nDr. John Redd, a captain in the U.S. Public Health Service, was sent in September by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to Sierra Leone, one of the three West African countries most devastated by the Ebola epidemic.

Drinking...two to six cups a day is said to do the trick.\n\nThe study, which analyzed the relationship between coffee consumption and mortality from all causes, states in its conclusion: “Light to moderate coffee intake is associated with a reduced risk of death from all causes.” The study was published in Public Health Nutrition, and involved over a million people.\n\nOf course, “all-cause death” is extremely general. How does coffee consumption affect specific health complications such as heart disease, neurological disorders and bone density?\n\nGiven the controversy about the association between coffee and heart complications, researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that look at the relationship between coffee consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n\nThey found that the relationship is non-linear—those who drink seven cups a day do not have a higher risk of CVD than those who don’t drink coffee. However, that was not the most interesting finding. The study also concluded that those who consume a moderate amount of coffee—three to five cups a day—had a lower risk of CVD than those who do not drink coffee at all.\n\nSimilar conclusions have been made from studies on how coffee affects chances of heart failure and developing type 2 diabetes. For decreasing chances of heart failure, the largest inverse association is four servings a day. Those who consume six to seven cups, apparently, have the lowest risk of developing type 2 diabetes—their chances are massively reduced by a third.\n\nOne of the largest perceived issues with coffee consumption—and caffeine in general—is the old wives’ tale that it can stunt growth and onset osteoporosis. However, if studies are to be believed, those assumptions are completely unfounded—there is no association between overall caffeine consumption and bone mineral.\n\nCaffeine’s beneficial effects on neurological health is well documented. Not only does it keep people on their toes, it lowers the risk of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and decreases cognitive decline on the whole. It goes to show that kick starting your brain with a daily cup of Joe prolongs its well-being over time.\n\nWith this in mind, coffee-fanatics need to remember these health benefits don’t change the fact that the good stuff is bad for teeth. Due to its high acidity levels, it will continue to stain teeth and dissolve tooth enamel.\n\nBut it’s not all bad news for those who share a love for coffee and pearly whites. According to a study from the Federal University of Rio de Janiero, coffee actually attacks plaque-forming bacteria—think of it as using bleach. It kills bacteria on the surface … but leaves rough hands and thin, grey nails.\n\nIt is important to note that all of these studies are on coffee—black coffee—that is not loaded with 500+ calories worth of sugar and milk. So don’t start making daily trips to Starbucks for a venti peppermint white chocolate mocha in the name of good health.\n\nNone of these studies suggest that patients should start consuming coffee as a way to battle their conditions. Rather, they suggest that the notion of coffee as an unhealthy drink is not as scientifically supported as one may think.\n\nSo don’t feel so guilty when drinking the fourth cup of the day—and with that in mind here are some of the ‘best’ cafes the emerald city has to offer:", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nHere is something we have all heard before: Coffee is unhealthy.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00004-of-00064--33", "original_text": "MR. BLITZER: Let me bring in Senator Obama, because you’ve been among those critical of Senator Clinton. You’ve suggested she’s triangulating, whatever that means, on some of the key issues; she’s running a textbook Washington campaign, you’ve suggested that. I want you to explain, if you don’t mind, Senator, what do you mean by that?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, first of all, I’m really happy to be here in Nevada and I appreciate this opportunity.\n\nSenator Clinton, I think, is a capable politician, and I think that she has run a terrific campaign. But what the American people are looking for right now is straight answers to tough questions. And that is not what we’ve seen out of Senator Clinton on a host of issues, on the issue of driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants.\n\nWe saw in the last debate that it took not just that debate but two more weeks before we could get a clear answer in terms of where her position was. The same is true on Social Security. We have serious disagreements about how we’re going to make sure that Social Security is there for the people who need it.\n\nAnd what I’m absolutely convinced of is that right now, we need a different kind of politics. Everywhere I go, all throughout Nevada, people are struggling with health care. People are working harder for less. They are having a tougher time saving, tougher time retiring. And part of the reason is because they don’t feel that Washington is listening to them.\n\nAnd what I want to do in this campaign is make certain that we are breaking out of the gridlock and partisanship and the standard practices of Washington and actually start listening to the American people to get things done.\n\nSenator Clinton, do you want to respond?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I hear what Senator Obama is saying, and he talks a lot about stepping up and taking responsibility and taking strong positions. But when it came time to step up and decide whether or not he would support universal health care coverage, he chose not to do that. His plan would leave 15 million Americans out. That’s about the population of Nevada, Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire.\n\nI have a universal health care plan that covers everyone. I’ve been fighting this battle against the special interest for more than 15 years, and I am proud to fight this battle. You know, we can have a different politic, but let’s not forget here that the people who we’re against are not going to be giving up without a fight. The Republicans are not going to vacate the White House voluntarily. We have some big issues ahead of us, and we need someone who is tested and ready to lead. I think that’s what my candidacy offers. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nSenator Obama. SEN. OBAMA: Well, let’s talk about health care right now because the fact of the matter is that I do provide universal health care. The only difference between Senator Clinton’s health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated -- forced -- them to get health care. That’s not what I’m seeing around Nevada. What I see are people who would love to have health care. They -- they desperately want it. But the problem is they can’t afford it, which is why we have put forward legislation -- (cheers, applause) -- we’ve put forward a plan that makes sure that it is affordable to get health care that is as good as the health care that I have as a member of Congress. (Applause.)\n\nSEN. OBAMA: That’s what the American people are looking for. That’s what they deserve. And that’s why I intend to provide as president of the United States.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Wolf, I -- Wolf, I cannot let that go unanswered.\n\nYou know, the most important thing here is to level with the American people. Senator Obama’s health care plan does not cover everyone. He starts with children, which is admirable -- I helped to create the Children’s Health Insurance Program back in 1997. I’m totally committed -- (applause) --\n\nSEN. OBAMA: That’s not true, Wolf.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- to making sure every single child is covered. He does not mandate the kind of coverage that I do. And I provide a health care tax credit under my American Health Choices Plan so that every American will be able to afford the health care. I open up the congressional plan. But there is a big difference between Senator Obama and me. He starts from the premise of not reaching universal health care.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Hold on. One at a -- one at a time.\n\nMR. : (Inaudible) -- in control. (Applause.)\n\nSEN. OBAMA: No, I understand, but look, I’m not going to --\n\nMR. BLITZER: Senator Obama, we’re going to have a lot more on health care.\n\nMR. : There’s no -- (inaudible).\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I will be very brief on this issue. Hillary states --\n\nSEN. OBAMA: -- states that she wants -- she states that she wants to mandate health care coverage, but she’s not garnishing people’s wages to make sure that they have it.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: She’s not --\n\nSEN. OBAMA: She is -- she is --\n\nMR. BLITZER: Go ahead, Senator.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: She is not -- she is not enforcing this mandate.\n\nAnd I don’t think that the problem with the American people is that they are not being forced to get health care.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: The problem is, they can’t afford it. And that is why my plan provides the mechanism to make sure that they can. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right, we’re going to get back on health care shortly because we have a lot more to talk about. (Cross talk.)\n\nI want Senator Edwards to weigh in, because you’ve spoken about the politics of parsing in your criticism of Senator Clinton. I want you to explain what that means.\n\nMR. EDWARDS: Well, can I say first, nobody on this stage is perfect, and that certainly includes me. (Cross talk.) And I don’t claim perfection, far from it.\n\nWhat I would say is that the issue is whether we can have a president that can restore trust for the American people in the president of the United States. (Applause.) Because I think this president has destroyed that trust, and I think there are fair questions to be asked of all of us, including Senator Clinton.\n\nSenator Clinton says she will end the war. She also says she will continue to keep combat troops in Iraq and continue combat missions in Iraq. She says she will turn up the heat on George Bush and the Republicans. But when the crucial vote came on stopping Bush, Cheney and the neocons on Iran, she voted with Bush and Cheney. (Applause.)\n\nOn the issue of Social Security, she said, standing beside me on the stage, that she would not do anything about the cap on Social Security taxes. And she has said privately to people, because it’s been reported in the press, that, in fact, she would consider raising that cap. And the most important issue is, she says she will bring change to Washington while she continues to defend a system that does not work, that is broken, that is rigged and is corrupt, corrupted against the interest of most Americans and corrupted -- (cheers, applause).\n\nMR. EDWARDS: Let me -- and corrupted for a very small, very powerful, very well-financed --\n\nMR. BLITZER: We’re going to --\n\nMR. EDWARDS: So we have fundamental differences.\n\nMR. BLITZER: We’re going to get all of these issues, including energy and Iran and everything else.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, Wolf, I’ve just been personally attacked again.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Senator Clinton, I’ll let you respond because there was a direct charge made against you.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: And I -- thank you. Yes.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Then we’re going to bring in everybody. Everyone’s going to get time tonight. Don’t worry. We got a lot of time.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, you know, I respect all of my colleagues on this stage -- (laughter) -- and, you know, we’re Democrats and we’re trying to nominate the very best person we can to win. And I don’t mind taking hits on my record, on issues, but when somebody starts throwing mud, at least we can hope that it’s both accurate and not right out of the Republican playbook because what I -- (cheers, applause) -- what I believe is important is that we put forth what we stand for. I have been active for 35 years. The American people know where I stand.\n\nYou know, Senator Edwards raised health care again. When Senator Edwards ran in 2004, he wasn’t for universal health care. I’m glad he is now. But for him to be throwing this mud and making these charges, I think, really detracts from what we’re trying to do here tonight. We need to put forth a positive agenda for America -- (cheers, applause) --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- telling people what we’re going to do when we get the chance to go back to the White House.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Senator Edwards, we’re going to give you a chance in a second. (Continued cheers, applause.)\n\nWe’re going to give Senator Edwards a chance to respond. I want Senator -- Senator Biden to weigh in.\n\nSEN. BIDEN: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: I want you to weigh in.\n\nSEN. BIDEN: Don’t do it. No. Don’t make me speak.\n\nMR. BLITZER: I want you to. Go ahead.\n\nWhat do you think -- Senator Biden, here’s the question. What do you think about this exchange among Democrats? Is that good for the Democrats or is it bad?\n\nSEN. BIDEN: Hey, look, let’s get to it, folks. The American people don’t give a darn about any of this stuff that’s going on up here. Look, they’re sitting -- now, seriously, think about it. They’re sitting down at their table tonight, they’ve put their kids to bed, and they’re worrying about whether or not their child’s going to run into a drug dealer on the way to school.\n\nThey're worrying about whether or not they're going to be able to pay for their mortgage, because even if they didn't have one of those subprime mortgages, things are looking bad for them. They're worrying about whether they're going to keep their job. And they're worrying about their son in the National Guard's going to get killed in Iraq. (Applause.)\n\nLadies and gentlemen, look, every -- every political campaign gets to this place. And I'm not criticizing any of the three people who are the ones who always get to talk all the time at these events. (Laughter.) I'm not. I'm not. I'm not criticizing. But look, folks, let's get straight to it here. This is not about experience, it's not about change, it's about action.\n\nWho among us is going to be able to on day one step in, (end ?) the war. Who among us understands what to do about Pakistan? Who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with Putin and tell him to lay off Georgia because Saakashvili is in real trouble? Who among us knows what they're doing?\n\nI have 35 years of experience. While everyone's talking about their experience -- and Hillary has a great experience, and John and the rest of them -- I was passing the Violence Against Women Act. I was passing the crime bill.\n\nMR. BLITZER (?): All right.\n\nMR. BIDEN: I was passing -- you're right. (Extended cheers and applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Let me just point out, everyone's going to have plenty of time tonight. I want John Roberts to go ahead and ask the next question, and then we'll bring everybody in, I promise.\n\nMR. ROBERTS: Senator Clinton, you were saying just a moment ago -- (laughter) -- (boos) -- that you -- the question's not going to her, by the way. Reiterating what she said. You said you're not -- you think it's legitimate for you to take hits on your record. Well, some of those hits on your record have come from the far right-hand side of the stage, from Senator Edwards, who has frequently attacked you for flip-flopping.\n\nBut Senator, you have changed your position on several issues. You were for the Yucca Mountain nuclear repository before you were against it. You were for the Iraq war before you were against it. People change their positions. If it's fair for you to change your position, is it not fair for her to change hers? (Applause.)\n\nSEN. EDWARDS: It's absolutely fair. But -- (applause) -- it's absolutely fair for people to learn from their experience and grow and mature and change. Anybody who's not willing to change based on what they learn is ignorant, and everybody ought to be willing to do that.\n\nThat's not what I'm saying. I'm saying there's a difference between that and saying exact -- saying two contrary things at exactly the same time. I mean, for example, just over the course of the last week, Senator Clinton said in Washington that she would vote for the Peru trade deal -- (boos) -- and she said in Iowa, talking to union members, that she wanted a moratorium on trade deals.\n\nThe important thing about this, though, is none of us -- none of us -- because the reality is -- and I want to add onto something that Joe Biden said. You know, before I came over here tonight, I was thinking, we're going to have this debate; when we finish, all of you are going to be on television saying, oh, who scored points, who won the debate. All of us are going to be fine. The question is, will America be fine?\n\nBecause what I saw -- (cheers, applause) -- before we came over here on your troll underneath the screen, 35 million Americans last year went hungry. Thirty-seven million people in this country live in poverty every day. Forty-seven million Americans have no health care coverage. And there is a fundamental choice that everyone in this room and Democratic voters have to make, and that is, who do you believe will take on this system and change it so that it is no longer rigged, corrupt and --\n\nMR. EDWARDS: -- rigged against the interests --\n\nMR. EDWARDS: -- of the American people. That is the fundamental choice. And I think people are entitled to know that they have choices. There's nothing personal about this. This is about what America needs to be. This is about those 35 million people --\n\nMR. EDWARDS: -- who are hungry every single year. When is our party --\n\nMR. EDWARDS: -- going to show a little backbone and strength --\n\nMR. EDWARDS: -- and courage and speak up --\n\nMR. EDWARDS: -- for those people who have been left behind? (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right. Hold on one second.\n\nI want Senator Dodd to weigh in, Senator Dodd, because you said -- made a statement earlier in the week -- and I'm quoting you now -- you're \"surprised at just how angry Senator Edwards has become.\"\n\nAnd you've suggested he's not the same person I once knew. (Laughter.)\n\nGo ahead and elaborate. Tell us what you mean.\n\nSEN. DODD: Well, let me pick up on this point here. I think, first of all, we Democrats have a job to do, and that is to unite this party, attract independents, Republicans who are seeking change to join us 12 months from now and elect a Democrat to the White House and to hold on to the House and Senate. That's number one. (Cheers, applause.) And it's going to take more than just getting people in our own party to support us. We're going to have to reach out.\n\nThere's a shrillness to the debate. The American people want results. They want the job done, exactly what Joe Biden talked about here. When people get up in the morning and go to work, they sit around and they worry about their jobs, their retirement, their health care, their kids' education, and they wonder if anybody in Washington is paying any attention to them and whether or not the job is being done on their behalf. And frankly, when a campaign is about turning up the heat or who's angrier or who's yelling louder, the American people turn off, in terms of listening. They want us to come together. They want a president that can lead the country. We want a Democratic candidate who can unite our party, and I think if we waste time on the shrillness of this debate, then we lose the American people. So it's important to focus on those.\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: By the way, I'm Bill Richardson. I'm the governor of New Mexico. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) Nice to meet you all.\n\nYou know, it seems that John wants to start a class war. It seems that Barack wants to start a generational war. It seems that Senator Clinton with all due respect on her plan on Iraq doesn't end the war -- (audio break from source). (Laughter, cheers.) And I say that -- I say that because these are the fundamental issues.\n\nDo our plans end the war? Do our plans make America energy independent? Do our plans give health care to every American? Are we creating jobs and economic growth? Are we resolving the real problems affecting this country? You know, let's stop this mud slinging. Let's stop this going after each other on character, on trust. Let us debate the issues that affect the American people -- (cheers, applause) -- and let us be positive. Let's be positive.\n\nMR. BLITZER: I just want to go down the line and ask everyone, and then we're going to move on to the next question.\n\nJust to be precise because there was a little confusion, thanks to Senator Edwards earlier in the week, I just want to make sure I fully understand all of you Democrats. Are you ready to commit absolutely, positively that you will support the Democratic nominee, no matter who that nominee is, no ifs, ands or buts?\n\nMR. EDWARDS: Is that a planted question?\n\nMR. BLITZER: Yes, I planted it. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. EDWARDS: Yes, I absolutely will support the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nSEN. DODD: Absolutely yes. (Applause.)\n\nREP. KUCINICH: Only if they oppose war as an instrument of policy. (Applause.)\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Yes, I will support the nominee.\n\nSEN. BIDEN: Hell, no, I wouldn't support any of these guys. (Laughter.)\n\nNo, I'm joking, joking. Of course, for them all.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Campbell, go ahead.\n\nMS. BROWN: All right, let's talk about the issues.\n\nSenator Obama, I want to ask you about immigration. It's an important issue in this state in particular. There are between 100,000 to 200,000 illegal immigrants here in Nevada. And you've supported various benefits for illegal immigrants, including driver's licenses and in-state college tuition.\n\nWhat do you say to those Americans who say they are losing out because you would give benefits to people who broke the laws of this country, who came here illegally? And then more generally as president, where do you draw the line when it comes to benefits for illegal immigrants?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I would say that they're justified in feeling frustrated because this administration -- the Bush administration -- has done nothing to control the problem that we have. We've had 5 million undocumented workers come over the borders since George Bush took office. It has become an extraordinary problem, and the reason the American people are concerned is because they are seeing their own economic position slip away.\n\nAnd oftentimes employers are exploiting these undocumented workers. They're not paying them minimum wage. They're not observing worker safety laws. (Applause.) And so what we have to do is create a comprehensive solution to the problem.\n\nNow, I have already stated that, as president, I will make sure that we finally have the kind of border security that we need. That's step number one. (Applause.)\n\nStep number two is to take on employers. Right now, they -- an employer has more of a chance of getting hit by lightning than be prosecuted for hiring an undocumented worker. That has to change. They have to be held accountable. (Applause.)\n\nAnd when we do those things -- when we do those things, I believe that we can take the undocumented workers, the illegal aliens who are here, get them out of the shadows, make sure that they are subject to a stiff penalty, make sure that they're learning English, make sure that they go to the back of the line so they're not getting an advantage over people who came here legally. And when we do that, I think that we can, instead of shedding all this heat, start shedding some light on the problem, and we can once again be a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. That's what I intend to do as president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right. I want to just press you on this point because it's a logical follow-up, and then I want to go and ask everyone. On the issue that apparently tripped up Senator Clinton earlier, the issue of driver's licenses for illegal immigrants, I take it, Senator Obama, you support giving driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. Is that right?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: When I was a state senator in Illinois, I voted to require that illegal aliens get trained, get a license, get insurance to protect public safety. (Scattered applause.) That was my intention. And -- but I have to make sure that people understand the problem we have here is not drivers licenses. Undocumented workers don't come here to drive. (Laughter.) They don't go -- they're not coming here to go to the In-N-Out Burger. That's not the reason they're here. They're here to work. And so instead of being distracted by what has now become a wedge issue, let's focus on actually solving the problem that --\n\nSEN. OBAMA: -- this administration, the Bush administration, has done nothing about.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Well, let's go through everybody because I want to be precise. I want to make sure the viewers and those of us who are here fully understand all of your positions on this.\n\nBarring, avoiding, assuming there isn't going to be comprehensive immigration reform, do you support or oppose drivers licenses for illegal immigrants?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I am not proposing that that's what we do. What I'm saying is that we can't -- (interrupted by laughter). No, no, no, no, look, I have already said I support the notion that we have to deal with public safety and that drivers licenses at the state level can make that happen. But what I also --\n\nSEN. OBAMA: But what I also know, Wolf, is that if we keep on getting distracted by this problem, then we are not solving it.\n\nMR. BLITZER: But -- because this is the kind of question that is sort of available for a yes or no answer. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) Either you support it or you oppose it. Let's go down and get a yes or no from everyone starting with Senator Edwards.\n\nSEN. EDWARDS: Tell me again what your question is. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Do you support drivers licenses for illegal immigrants?\n\nSEN. EDWARDS: If we don't have --\n\nMR. BLITZER: Assuming we don't -- in the absence of comprehensive immigration reform -- doesn't look like it's going to happen any time soon -- do you support drivers licenses for illegal immigrants?\n\nSEN. EDWARDS: No, but I don't accept the proposition that we're not going to have comprehensive immigration reform. What I do support -- (scattered applause) -- and what I will do as president of the United States is move this country toward comprehensive immigration reform --\n\nSEN. EDWARDS: -- and anyone who's on the path to earning American citizenship should be able to have a drivers license. (Scattered cheers, applause.)\n\nSEN. DODD: Well, it's important to put it in context. Obviously, look, clarity is important here. The American people in a debate like this want clarity here, and certainly the whole idea of getting immigration reform, something I strongly support -- but I believe part of our job is to discourage those who want to come here. I understand why they want to come, but coming illegally creates serious problems, 4(00,000) to 500,000.\n\nMR. BLITZER: So is that a yes or a no?\n\nSEN. DODD: No, my belief is that giving a driver's -- as I've said from the very beginning here, I think driver's licenses are the wrong thing to be doing in terms of attracting people to come here as undocumented.\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right. Thank you.\n\nSenator Obama, yes or no?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I am going to be fighting for comprehensive immigration reform, and we shouldn't pose the question that somehow we can't achieve that. I believe that the American people desperately want it. That's what I'm going to be fighting for as president.\n\nREP. KUCINICH: I take issue with your description of people being illegal immigrants. There aren't any illegal human beings; that's number one. Number two, they're undocumented. And I believe that the best way to do it -- (applause) -- thank you -- I believe the best way to deal with this is cancel NAFTA and renegotiate the trade agreement with Mexico. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Well, let me rephrase the question, Congressman.\n\nREP. KUCINICH: So the driver's --\n\nMR. BLITZER: If undocumented people in this country --\n\nREP. KUCINICH: Give people -- Wolf --\n\nMR. BLITZER: -- should be able to get driver's licenses.\n\nREP. KUCINICH: You give people a path to legalization, and then they can be legal and have their driver's license. That's the way to work it. That's the way to work it.\n\nMR. BLITZER: (Inaudible) -- comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nREP. KUCINICH: You know what? You give people a path to legalization, and you work to make sure that you don't criminalize their status any further. And again, I take exception to the way you frame that question. (Applause.)\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Well, my answer is yes, and I did it. You know why? Because the Congress -- I notice Barack mentioned the president, but the Congress also failed miserably to pass comprehensive immigration. And we need to have it in this country.\n\nI did it four years ago. My legislature sent me a bill. I signed it. My law enforcement people said it's a matter of public safety. What we need is public safety, a reduction in traffic fatalities. We wanted more people to be insured. When we started with this program, 33 percent of all New Mexicans had -- were uninsured. Today it's 11 percent. Traffic fatalities have gone down. It's a matter of public safety.\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: The states have to act when the federal government and the Congress doesn't act. The answer is comprehensive immigration. (Cheers, applause.) The answer is --\n\nMR. BLITZER: Your answer is yes.\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: -- secure the borders, a stronger relationship with Mexico. Those that knowingly hire illegal workers should be punished, and a path to legalization. That is the solution.\n\nSEN. BIDEN: No. (Laughter, applause.)\n\nMR. ROBERTS: Senator Dodd, a lot of people in this room no doubt are very concerned about the quality of education that their children will have, and how it will prepare them for post-secondary education and the working world after that. In workplaces across America, it's pretty common practice to reward high-performing employees with pay raises, and to terminate bad employees. However in our education system across the country, by and large in our nation's public schools, teachers unions make it difficult to do that.\n\nThe question is, what is wrong with rewarding a teacher who excels at the job that they're doing by paying them more than an average teacher would make? (Applause.)\n\nSEN. DODD: Well, I think if you define excelling by teachers who will go into poor rural or poor urban areas and make a difference, mentor children after school, put in extra time to make a difference, then I think that sort of merit pay has value. If you're judging excelling by determining whether or not that teacher has students who do better because they're in better neighborhoods or better schools, I'm totally opposed to that. That's not the way to be judging these matters. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nThis is a -- this is critical. I always say this is the single most important issue. I've been asked the question, over 26 years in the Senate, 1,000 times. It's a very difficult question to answer: What's the most important issue?\n\nThis is the most important issue. Every other issue we grapple with depends upon our ability to have the best educated generation we've ever produced. (Applause.) And we need to have, in my view, far more cooperation at the national level.\n\nWe spend less than 5 percent of the national budget on elementary and secondary education. That is deplorable in my view. It's basically -- (applause). We need to fundamentally reform No Child Left Behind. No Child Left Behind is a disaster for most schools and most people. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nI've spent -- I've spent 26 years in the Senate. I started the Children's Caucus 26 years ago with Arlen Specter. I wrote the legislation dealing with after-school programs, infant screening, autism issues as well. Spent a good deal of my time -- I -- Head Start Senator of the Decade by the Head Start Association. I've dedicated a good part of my public career to children and to education, one-quarter of the population but truly 100 percent of our future.\n\nThis is an issue that deserves far more attention. We ought to have one single debate on education. (Cheers, applause.) It comes up about once every two hours of the discussion. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: We're talking about education right now, and I want to bring Congressman Kucinich in because I know you're a strong supporter of the unions. The teachers' union, very powerful -- teachers' unions, very powerful. Are there any issues with unions -- teachers' unions, or other unions for that matter -- with which you disagree?\n\nREP. KUCINICH: My father was a truck driver. He was a member of the Teamsters. I happen to be a member of the IATSE. I think that the trade -- that the union movement is essential to upholding human rights. And I think that if we had trade agreements that had workers' rights in them, that would lift up conditions for workers in this country and in all countries.\n\nSo I'm the candidate of workers in this -- this campaign because I've stood for jobs for all, full-employment economy; health care for all; education for all. And the fact of the matter is that a Kucinich administration will mean a worker's White House.\n\nRight now wealth is being accelerated upwards, and I'm the one candidate in the race who comes right from the working class and can address those needs directly because I remember where I came from. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right. I take it the answer is there's nothing -- there's no issue -- no major issues. You disagree with America's unions.\n\nREP. KUCINICH: Well, you know, the Teamsters wanted to drill in Alaska. I voted against drilling in Alaska. So it's not like I'm a slam dunk on every issue. (Scattered applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right. Okay.\n\nREP. KUCINICH: But I'm for working people. That's why I'm up here.\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: I think the key -- I want to be the education president. The key to a good education is a strong teacher. One of the problems we have in this country is we disrespect teachers. We underpay them. (Cheers, applause.) I would have a minimum wage for all teachers starting out at $40,000 per year.\n\nAnd Chris, I think we need to be bolder with No Child Left Behind. I would junk it. This is a disaster. (Cheers, applause.) It's got to go. I would have preschool for every child. I'd have full day kindergarten. America is 29th in science to the European Union, to Japan. We need to have science and math academies, hire a hundred thousand science and math teachers, have art in the schools. We need also -- (interrupted by applause) -- we need also to have a college education policy that deals with these huge loans that are killing our college students. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAnd what I would do -- look, what I would do -- and you know, we're at a great college here.\n\nWhat I would do is, in exchange for two years of tuition, government pays tuition, one year of national service for this country. (Applause.) Those are the kind of creative solutions we want in this country.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Let me -- thank you, Governor. Thank you very much.\n\nI want Senator Clinton to weigh in. On the issue of merit pay, if there's a teacher out there who's doing a great job, should that teacher get merit -- get a bonus for doing a great job, that individual teacher who works really hard, does a great job educating young people?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I support school-based merit pay for a lot of the reasons Chris was talking about. We need to get more teachers to go into hard-to-serve areas. We've got to get them into underserved urban areas, underserved rural areas.\n\nBut the school is a team, and I think it's important that we reward that collaboration. You know, a child who moves from kindergarten to sixth grade, say, in the same school, every one of those teachers is going to affect that child.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Well, what if there's an excellent teacher in that team and a crummy teacher in that team, a teacher who's simply riding along and not really working very hard, not really educating those young kids? Do you give just everybody the merit pay, or do you give the individual teacher?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Wolf, you need to weed out the teachers who are not doing a good job. I mean, that's the bottom line. (Applause.) They should not be teaching our children.\n\nI mean, what I believe so strongly is that our education system has served this country very well. But we're in the 21st century. We do need to re-imagine it. We've got to get everybody to talk about it. But what I object to with the Bush administration is it's always talking down. We need to have a collegial collaboration. And the teachers need to be at the table --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- helping us figure out what the best way is to achieve our goals.\n\nMR. BLITZER: I want to move on to the next question, but I want Senator Biden to weigh in because I know your wife is a teacher. So go ahead. Should an excellent teacher be given merit pay?\n\nSEN. BIDEN: An excellent teacher should be judged by whether or not that teacher, outside of the classroom, improves themselves and their teaching skills. My wife got two master's degrees and a doctorate degree. That's merit pay. She went out there and she earned the ability to be able to demonstrate to everyone that she was an exceptional teacher, because she went out and she gathered this additional knowledge instead of being -- not just being a good teacher.\n\nHere's the problem with simple merit pay, based on the principle. Who makes the decision, based on merit pay? (Applause.) Who's the person who -- (inaudible)? I believe there should be teaching excellence. I think we should demand more of our teachers in continuing education. I think there should -- and unions don't like that. I think we should demand more of the teachers in terms of their participation after school and in school. But I think you've got to pay them.\n\nAnd the last point I'll make is Bill is correct; you have to -- look, the idea you start teachers at $28,000 in most states when, in the countries we're competing with, they start off and they graduate their -- the graduating seniors are getting the same pay that engineers are getting in those same schools.\n\nMy father has an expression, God love him, before he passed away. He'd say, \"Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I will tell you what you value.\" I've laid out a $30 billion plan -- (applause) -- over five years --\n\nSEN. BIDEN: -- (to pay ?) -- 16 years of education is what our kids need. They need to start two years earlier and be guaranteed two years after school.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\nMS. BROWN: Senator Biden, a question on Pakistan. As you know, in the past few weeks Pakistani leader Pervez Musharraf has declared a state of emergency there. He's dismissed several Supreme Court justices. He has recently placed opposition leader Benazir Bhutto under house arrest twice now and imprisoned numerous other dissenters.\n\nAnd I know you spoke with Musharraf last week. And you, along with several others on this stage, assert that the U.S. should maintain its current level of financial support for Pakistan. And my question is, is it your view that there are times when the security of the United States is more important than the way a key ally like Musharraf disregards freedom and disregards democracy?\n\nSEN. BIDEN: First of all, I do not think we should maintain the same aid we're giving. I have made it clear to Musharraf personally, when he called me, and I've spoken personally to Bhutto -- before, I might add, the president spoke to either one of them -- I spoke to them and I indicated very clearly two things.\n\nOne, if he did not take off his uniform, if he did not hold fair and free elections by the middle of January, I would, on the floor of the Senate, move to take away the aid we're giving with regard to F- 16s and P-3s, because that's the biggest leverage you have on him within his military. He is not a sole player. He has to keep his military happy as well. I would use that leverage.\n\nSecondly, I've indicated that what we should do is move from a Musharraf policy to a Pakistan policy. Unlike anyone else, within five days of this happening I laid out a detailed plan. The president hasn't. No one on this stage has. No one else has -- a detailed plan as president how I would proceed with Iraq. And you have to move from military aid to giving to the middle class there. The middle class is overwhelmingly the majority. They get no connection with the United States. We have to significantly increase our economic aid relative to education, relative to NGOs, relative to all those things that make a difference in the lives of ordinary people over there, and not be doing it through the military side.\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right, thank you.\n\nSEN. BIDEN: I know there's more to say, Campbell. I appreciate you asking me the question and I'm sorry I answered it. I know you're not supposed to answer questions, based on what I've heard. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Well, let me bring in Governor Richardson.\n\nGovernor Richardson, you've suggested cutting off military aid to Pakistan, so long as the Pakistani leader doesn't take these steps to restore the constitution, take off his military uniform, end the national state of emergency and have free and fair elections. But some are worried, including the opposition leader, Benazir Bhutto -- I spoke with her earlier this week -- that cutting off military aid to the Pakistan military could undermine U.S. national security.\n\nThis is a country that has nuclear weapons. It has a strong Taliban presence, an al Qaeda presence. Are you worried at all that as bad as President Musharraf might be, it could get a whole lot worse over there?\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Well, of course, I'm worried. But what happened with our Pakistan policy, we got our principles wrong. We forgot our principles, our principles that we said to Musharraf, you know, Musharraf, security is more important than human rights. If I'm president, it's the other way around -- (applause) -- democracy and human rights.\n\nWhat I would do is, yes, I would condition the assistance to Musharraf. We give him $10 billion. 60 percent of that is to his military. I would say, President Musharraf, unless you restore the constitution, unless you have elections in January, unless you end the state of emergency, unless you allow Benazir Bhutto to run as a candidate, unless you put the supreme court back.\n\nAnd something else we've forgotten: He is supposed to go after terrorists on his border, and he has done a very weak job of doing that. (Scattered applause.) And you know, I would condition the assistance.\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: But here is another point -- no, but here's another point. Pakistani -- in Pakistan -- in the politics of Pakistan, Islamic parties get maybe 15 percent of the vote. I mean, so this threat that, oh, revolutionary elements are going to overtake him -- if he has a fair election, and you take his party and Benazir Bhutto's party and you get the military --\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: -- I believe that moderate forces can win. So if we're on the side of democracy and human rights and we're on the side of Musharraf having elections, then U.S. interests are preserved and the Pakistani people have a democracy. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Let me just be precise because I want to make sure we all -- I heard you correctly. What you're saying, Governor, is that human rights, at times, are more important than American national security?\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Yes, because I believe we -- (applause) -- we need to find ways to say to the world that, you know, it's not just about what Halliburton wants in Iraq, it's also about our -- (cheers, applause) -- values of freedom, equality. Our strength is not just military and economic. Our strength as a nation is our values -- equality, freedom, democracy --\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right. All right.\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: -- human rights. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Senator Edwards, I want you to weigh in.\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: That's why we are strong.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Go ahead, Senator.\n\nMR. EDWARDS: Well, I think first of all, we have some basic goals that we need to be focused on with respect to Pakistan. One is to make sure that the extremists in northwest Pakistan are under control. Second, that we provide support for the democratic reformers. Third is that -- Senator Biden just spoke about, to make sure these elections take place in January. And fourth, we need to make certain that the nuclear weapons are under control.\n\nNow, this leads to a bigger question. I think Pakistan is the living, breathing example that America's ad hoc policy of dealing with the spread of nuclear weapons, while it's absolutely required in today's world given what's happening with Iran, given what we see today in Pakistan and the incredible fragility of the administration in Pakistan and the presence of extraordinary extremist elements within Pakistan, that this is the living, breathing example --\n\nMR. EDWARDS: -- of a policy that will not work over the long term.\n\nI'm about to finish. What we have to do, what America needs to do and what I will do as president of the United States is to lead a long-term international effort to rid the world of nuclear weapons.\n\nIt is the only way we're going to keep the world secure and keep America secure. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right. Everybody's going to have a chance.\n\nSenator Obama, is human rights more important than American national security?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: The concepts are not contradictory, Wolf.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Because occasionally they could clash.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: They -- they --- they -- they -- they are complementary, and I think Pakistan is a great example. Look, we paid $10 billion over the last seven years, and we two goals, deal with terrorism and restore democracy, and we've gotten neither. And Joe and Bill are exactly right on this. Pakistan's democracy would strengthen our battle against extremists. The more we see repression, the more there are no outlets for how people can express themselves and their aspirations, the worse off we're going to be and the more anti-American sentiment there's going to be in the Middle East. We keep on making this mistake.\n\nAs president, I will do everything that is required to make sure that nuclear weapons don't fall into the hands of extremists, especially going after al Qaeda in the hills between Afghanistan and Pakistan. But we've got to understand that if we simply prop up anti- democratic practices, that that feeds the sense that America is only concerned about us and that our fates are not tied to these other folks.\n\nAnd that's -- that's going to make us less safe. That's something I intend to change as president. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Hold on. Hold on one second. Hold on. Senator Dodd --\n\nMR. : I do not agree with (it ?).\n\nMR. BLITZER: Senator Dodd, I want you to weigh in. What's more important when they clash, human rights versus national security?\n\nSEN. DODD: Well, first of all, I hope -- maybe other people find it as ironic as I do to have President Bush urging the Turks not to invade the Kurdish areas of Iraq and lecturing Musharraf about restoring the constitution. This is an administration that has stepped all over our own Constitution in the process. (Applause.)\n\nAnd this isn't -- elections are -- there's an expression in Spanish that says elections --\n\nMR. BLITZER: So what's more important, human rights or national security?\n\nSEN. DODD: Well, obviously national security, keeping the country safe. When you take the oath of office on January 20th --\n\nSEN. BIDEN (?): That's right.\n\nSEN. DODD: -- you promise to do two things, and that is to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States and protect our country against enemies both foreign and domestic. The security of the country is number one, obviously, yes, all right?\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right. Okay, thank you.\n\nSEN. DODD: Now secondly, this doesn't mean -- elections are only one note, as they say, in the tune of democracy here. Be careful what you wish for. If they were totally free elections in many of these countries we're talking about today, the Islamic jihad or the Islamic Brotherhood would win 85 percent of the vote. That's not a great outcome for us at this point here.\n\nSEN. DODD: So we need to have a sense of balance about this here.\n\nI disagree with those who suggest here that we ought to condition Musharraf's actions regarding some of these issues on aid and assistance here.\n\nThere's only one way in Afghanistan; it's through Pakistan. The generals in the military control the nuclear weaponry here. We need to move and remind Musharraf that there are obligations he needs to fulfill. Be careful here about --\n\nMR. BLITZER: (Inaudible) -- you answered. You answered the question, Senator.\n\nSEN. DODD: Let me finish Musharraf, because literally, then you have to do what you say you're going to do. And if he doesn't do what he's suggesting, then you have to terminate that relationship, and that puts this country in a very, very dangerous position.\n\nMR. BLITZER: You say national security is more important than human rights.\n\nSenator Clinton, what do you say?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: I agree with that completely. I mean the first obligation of the president of the United States is to protect and defend the United States of America. That doesn't mean that it is to the exclusion of other interests.\n\nAnd there's absolutely a connection between a democratic regime and heightened security for the United States. That's what's so tragic about this situation. After 9/11, President Bush had a chance to chart a different course, both in Pakistan and in Afghanistan, and could have been very clear about what our expectations were. We are now in a bind, and it is partly -- not completely, but partly -- a result of the failed policies of the Bush administration.\n\nSo, where we are today means that we have to say to President Musharraf: Look, this is not in your interest either. This is not in the interest of the United States. It is not in your interest to either stay in power or stay alive. We have to figure out how we're going to navigate this.\n\nWhen I was meet ing with him earlier this year, I asked him if he would accept a high-level presidential envoy to begin to negotiate some of these issues.\n\nHe said, yes, I got back; I called the White House; I asked them to send such a high-level envoy. They did not do it; they're going to send one now.\n\nSo I mean, you've got to stay on top of this and you have to manage it all the time. That requires presidential attention. We haven't had that, and part of the reason is obvious now. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Stand by. Stand by.\n\nYou're going to have a chance.\n\nMR. ROBERTS: All right, to Governor Richardson, a military police unit from the Nevada National Guard, stationed about 12 miles from here, just left for its third tour of duty in Iraq. I want to talk to you for just a moment here about the effect of the troop increase over there. It's true that 2007 is the deadliest year so far, since 2003, for American forces.\n\nBut it's also true that U.S. troop deaths have been declining steadily since the spring. And in fact, in the month of October, they were at their lowest level in nearly two years. At the same time, there has been a marked decline in the number of deaths of Iraqi people.\n\nIs General David Petraeus correct when he says that the troop increase is bringing security to Iraq?\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: John, we shouldn't be talking about body counts. One American death is too much.\n\nAnd -- (interrupted by cheers, applause) -- what I am saying here is the surge is not working. There is less -- right now less possibility of a political solution. Three out of the 18 benchmarks -- the General Accounting Office -- have been fulfilled. Even among Republican math is a failing grade. (Laughter.) What I'm saying, also, is that look at this statistic -- 65 percent of the Iraqi people now say it's okay to shoot an American soldier. Our troops are dying -- over 3,800, two today, 60,000 wounded, casualties, mainly mental trauma.\n\nNow, my position is that we get the troops out in a year. Leave no residual forces behind unlike some of my colleagues here that want to leave some until 2013, but not just wave goodbye because we have a responsibility, and that is, one, to get a political compromise, a U.S.-led political compromise among the three groups; that they share power -- the Sunni, the Shi'a, the Kurds -- that they share oil revenues; that we have an all-Muslim, all-Arab peacekeeping force with some European forces headed by the U.N.; a donor conference that involves other countries; European Union, rich Arab states contributing to the reconstruction of Iraq, where we have spent --\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: -- $500 billion --\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator (sic/Governor).\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: -- in this war when this money should be used in America for health care, education and for kids. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Congressman Kucinich, is the troop increase right now --\n\nMR. BLITZER: Is the troop increase, as General Petraeus has put forward over these past few months, is it working?\n\nREP. KUCINICH: No, the occupation is fueling the insurgency. In 2003, I put forth a plan to get out of Iraq. I'm actually the only one on this stage who voted against the war, voted against funding the war a hundred percent of the time -- (cheers, applause) -- and also who has a plan to bring the troops home, and they should be brought home now. (Applause.)\n\nAnd let me tell you something. The Democrats in Congress have not done the right thing for the American people. They should tell President Bush we're not going to give you another time. We're not putting a bill on the floor. Bring them home now. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAlso, when you talked about Pakistan you didn't get a chance to me on that question, but I want to point something out to you, Wolf. You cannot look at Pakistan and the destabilization that's occurring in many Muslim nations without understanding the role that our aggression against Iraq has played in contributing to that destabilization. (Applause.)\n\nSo I'm speaking about a new policy of strength through peace, no more unilateralism, no more preemption, no more first strike -- to open dialogue, diplomacy, adherence to international law. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\nSenator Obama, I'll put the same question to you. Is General Petraeus' strategy working?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: There is no doubt that because we put American troops in Iraq -- more American troops in Iraq, that they are doing a magnificent job, and they are making a difference in certain neighborhoods.\n\nBut the overall strategy is failed, because we have not seen any change in behavior among Iraq's political leaders. And that is the essence of what we should be trying to do in Iraq.\n\nThat's why I'm going to bring this war to a close. That's why we can get our combat troops out within 16 months. That's why we have to initiate the kind of regional diplomacy -- not just talking to our friends but talking to our enemies, like Iran and Syria, to try to stabilize the situation there. (Applause.)\n\nBut I just want to make this important point because all of us, as we're campaigning, we're seeing this in human terms. People are on two, three, four tours of duty. Families are carrying an enormous burden.\n\nThis year, we saw the highest casualty rates for American troops in Iraq since this war started. The same, by the way, is true in Afghanistan. If we have seen a lowering violence rate, that's only compared to earlier this year. We're back to where we started back in 2006.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: And so the notion that somehow because we've gone from horrific violence to just intolerable levels of violence, and that somehow that justifies George Bush's strategy, is absolutely wrong. And I'm going to bring it to a halt when I'm president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Senator.\n\nMS. BROWN: Congressman Kucinich, we're approaching the holiday season right now and parents across the country are in a panic. They are riffling through their toy boxes, they are throwing things away, because they are so worried that toys, the products coming from China right now are too dangerous for their children.\n\nDo you believe that the people on the stage who voted to fully open trade relations with China bear some of the responsibility for what's going on right now?\n\nREP. KUCINICH: Well, of course they do; I mean, in the same way that people who voted for the war bear responsibility for what's going on, people who voted for the Patriot Act bear responsibility for what's going on -- (cheers, applause) -- people who voted for Yucca Mountain bear responsibility. People have to take responsibility for their positions.\n\nNow, let's talk about China trade. The fact of the matter is, Wolf, it was well known when China trade came up that China doesn't have environmental quality standards, doesn't have health standards, doesn't have workers' rights, doesn't permit people to form unions. Everyone knew that.\n\nAnd for someone to come up afterwards -- and I think in the last debate I think Hillary Clinton was criticized by John Edwards for some trade-related issue; but the fact of the matter is, John, you voted for China trade understanding that workers were going to be hurt.\n\nNow, you're a trial lawyer. You knew better. I'm saying that it's important -- (boos) --\n\nMR. BLITZER: Senator Edwards, he made a -- he made a specific reference to you.\n\nREP. KUCINICH: This is a fact, though. I mean, I'm not backing down from this. This is a fact.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Well, let's let --\n\nREP. KUCINICH: People have to take responsibility for their positions. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Let's ask Senator Edwards to respond. Was that vote a mistake?\n\nMR. EDWARDS: Well -- (chuckles) -- I'm not sure what being a trial lawyer has to do with it, but -- what my response is --\n\nMR. EDWARDS: -- America -- America's trade -- (laughs) -- cute. Cute, Dennis. (Applause.)\n\nI think America's -- America's trade policy has been a complete disaster. I do believe that. NAFTA, CAFTA, Colombia, Korea, Peru -- which we're now considering -- has been a complete and total disaster.\n\nAnd I think it's really important to pull what's been happening with trade into the bigger picture of what's happening with America because what I believe is that powerful interests -- particularly big corporate interests -- have literally taken over this government, and they've taken over it against the interests of ordinary Americans. (Applause.) And a living, breathing example of that is, in 1993, when we were in control of the White House, of the United States Senate and the United States House, we made an effort to pass universal health care.\n\nThe big drug companies, insurance companies and their lobbyists killed it. At the same time, NAFTA was put on the table.\n\nSEN. EDWARDS: The big corporations in America were for NAFTA.\n\nSo what did we get with a Democratic Congress, with a Democratic president? We didn't -- no, let me finish this. We didn't get something that America desperately needed, which is universal health care, but we got something America did not need, which is NAFTA, which has cost us millions of jobs. (Applause.) We will not change this country if we replace a crowd of corporate Republicans with corporate Democrats. (Cheers, applause.) We have to give the power in this democracy back to the American people. That's what's at stake in this election.\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right. I'm going to let Senator Clinton respond, but let me just rephrase the question.\n\nWas your vote to normalize trade relations with China a mistake?\n\nMR. EDWARDS: I think what's the mistake is allowing China to operate unfettered, to send dangerous products into this country, to not have the president of the United States hold them responsible for their trading obligations or the WTO, which has not been done.\n\nMR. BLITZER: So it was a mistake?\n\nMR. EDWARDS: I think it was right to bring them into WTO. It's wrong to not hold them responsible for their obligations.\n\nSenator Clinton, all of us remember the big NAFTA debate when your husband was president of the United States, and a lot of us remember the debate between Al Gore, who was then vice president, and Ross Perot. Ross Perot was fiercely against NAFTA.\n\nKnowing what we know now, was Ross Perot right? (Laughter.)\n\nSEN. CLINTON: All I can remember from that is a bunch of charts. (Laughter.) That sort of is a vague memory.\n\nLook, NAFTA did not do what many had hoped, and so we do need to take a look at it and we do need to figure out how we're going to have trade relations that are smart, that give the American worker and the American consumer rights around the world.\n\nAnd I want to go back to Campbell's question for a minute because it's really related to this. It is something that every parent should be worried about. It's not only the toys; it's the pet food, it's the medical components and prescription drugs. If we don't impose a third-party, independent investigative arm on our corporations that do business in China as well as the Chinese government, we should not permit any items to be imported into our country until we're sure they're safe. (Applause.) I mean, that to me is rule number one. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right. So let me rephrase the question. I'll rephrase the question. Was NAFTA a mistake?\n\nREP. KUCINICH: It was passed in the Clinton administration.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Was NAFTA a mistake?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: NAFTA was a mistake to the extent that it did not deliver on what we had hoped it would, and that's why I call for a trade timeout when I am president. I'm going to evaluate every trade agreement. We do need to get back to enforcing the ones we have, which the Bush administration has not done. They have totally abdicated that. But I think we have to get broader than that. We've got to have enforceable labor and environmental standards. We've got the WTO that enforces financial and corporate rights; we need the International Labor Organization and other mechanisms that will be there to enforce labor rights and environmental rights, and that's what I intend to do as president. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: I want to go to John Roberts in a second, but I know Senator Dodd and Senator Obama want to weigh in on this.\n\nSEN. DODD: Well, first of all, look: I respect the fact that we're calling for timeouts, but as was pointed out earlier by John Edwards, we've had Senator Obama and Senator Clinton both came out in support of the Peruvian free trade agreement -- now switching our positions on these issues here for the convenience of a debate and discussion on where polling data may be.\n\nWe are in a global economy. It is critically important that we do everything we can to expand those markets so that our products and our services can be sold in foreign nations here. It was outrageous in a sense here -- had a U.S. corporation produced contaminated toys or food, they would have been shut down in 20 minutes.\n\nSEN. DODD: I called upon the president to put a moratorium on trade coming out of China when those products were announced to be contaminated. It should have stopped right then and there for eternity. (Applause.)\n\nSenator Obama, was NAFTA a mistake?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, first of all, I hope Chris is clear -- I haven't changed positions on Peru. I am intending to --\n\nSEN. DODD: Oh, you are for it.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I am for it, and I plan to vote for it because it is a small country.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: This is a trade agreement that has the labor agreements and the environmental agreements that we've been fighting for in it, and I think it's the right thing to do.\n\nI am opposed to CAFTA. I've been opposed to South Korea.\n\nBut going back to the issue of China -- you know what Japan does with the Chinese when it comes to, for example, food importation? They send their own inspectors over to China and they set up their own safety system and they say, \"If you don't abide by our rules, you can't send food into Japan.\"\n\nNow, the question is, why doesn't the United States impose these same rules and regulations as Japan has? (Cheers, applause.) This is the biggest market -- this is the biggest market in the world. China has to sell here.\n\nBut this goes back to how we did most favored nation trading status with China. The problem was we had one (level ?) when we allowed them in. We should have said, \"We will review this every single year, so if you are not behaving properly, if you are not safeguarding our consumers and we find that you are not looking out for American workers or the administration is not, we won't have that subject to review.\" That was the failure on that China bill.\n\nSEN. BIDEN: Wolf -- 30 seconds, Wolf. Thirty seconds.\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right -- 30 seconds. I've got to let Senator Biden --\n\nSEN. BIDEN: Look, it's not the agreement; it's the man. Under the WTO, we can shut this down. What are they all talking about here? It's about a president who won't enforce the law. (Applause.) When they contaminated chicken, what happened? They cut off all chickens going in from Delaware -- a $3 billion industry -- into China. They cut it off. We have power under the -- this agreement. I don't know what anybody's talking about here. Enforce the agreement.\n\nSEN. BIDEN: Shut it down. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\nREP. KUCINICH: (Inaudible) -- put it there from the beginning.\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right. Hold on.\n\nREP. KUCINICH: They weren't -- it wasn't in there from the beginning.\n\nEverybody's going to have a chance --\n\nREP. KUCINICH: It wasn't in there from the beginning. That -- it wasn't in there from the beginning -- (inaudible).\n\nMR. ROBERTS: Want to explore the energy issue for a moment here because it's been of particular importance to the state. Senator Obama, the price of oil is flirting with the $100-a-barrel mark right now, making all the more urgent the need for alternate fuel forces. You support nuclear energy as a part of the plan for the future, but there is an issue of what to do with the waste. You are opposed to the Yucca Mountain nuclear repository about 90 miles from here. Your state uses about -- gets about 48 percent of its power from nuclear compared to 20 percent for most other states.\n\nYet you are opposed to bringing nuclear waste from other states and keeping it in Illinois.\n\nThe question is, if not in your backyard, whose?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, as I've said, I don't think it's fair to send it to Nevada, because we're producing it. (Applause.)\n\nSo what we have to do is, we've got to develop the storage capacity based on sound science. Now, laboratories like Argonne in my own home state are trying to develop ways to safely store nuclear waste without having to ship it across the country and put it in somebody else's backyard. But keep in mind that I don't think nuclear power is necessarily our best option. It has to be part of our energy mix.\n\nWe have a genuine crisis that has to be addressed and as president, I intend to address it, and here's what we have to do. We have to, first of all, cap greenhouse gases, because climate change is real. And it's going to impact Nevada and it's impacting the entire planet. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nThat means that we're going to have to tell polluters, we are going to charge you money when you send pollution into the air, that's creating climate change. That money we can then reinvest in solar, in wind, in biodiesel, in clean coal technology and in superior nuclear technology.\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right. Senator, until there's some new technological breakthrough, as you would hope and all of us would hope, where do you send the waste?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, right now it is on site in many situations, and that is not the optimal situation, Wolf. But don't keep on assuming that we can't do something. I mean, this is about the third time where you said, \"assuming we can't do it, what's our option?\"\n\nMR. BLITZER: Well, until we -- until we do it.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, but I'm running for president because I think we can do it. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON (?): Wolf? Wolf?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I reject -- I reject the notion that we can't meet our energy challenges.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: We can if we've got bold leadership in the White House that is saying we are going to do something about climate change, we are going to develop renewable energy sources. That's what I intend to do as president. And we shouldn't, you know, be pessimistic about the future of America. (Scattered applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Okay. I'm optimistic. (Laughter.)\n\nGovernor Richardson's a former Energy secretary. What do you do with the nuclear waste in the interim?\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Well, you mentioned all the labs, Argonne, Yucca Mountain. I was in charge of them. Here's what you do.\n\nFirst, the future is renewable. It's not oil, it's not coal, it's not nuclear. (Applause.) What you do with the waste is you don't put it in Yucca Mountain. All my life -- as secretary of Energy, as a congressman -- I opposed the site for environmental reasons, water saturation.\n\nI don't think the answer, also, is in regional sites.\n\nThere's a technological solution, a scientific solution. What I would do, I would turn Yucca Mountain into a national laboratory. We have the greatest brains, our national lab scientists. We need to find a way to safely dispose of nuclear waste. There is a technological solution.\n\nBut while we do that, we shouldn't be giving the nuclear power industry all of these advantages in the Senate bills that are coming forth, or subsidies. Oil, coal and nuclear are getting most of the subsidies.\n\nWe need an energy revolution in this country -- (applause) -- to shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources by 50 percent by the year 2020. Eighty percent reduction of greenhouse emissions, a mandate.\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: We need to have 30 percent of our electricity renewable.\n\nAnd it's got to be also the American people -- I'm g going to say this honestly -- sacrificing a little bit when it comes to appliances -- (applause) -- and when it comes to being part of an energy efficiency revolution.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Governor.\n\nMS. BROWN: Senator Clinton, you went to your alma mater recently, Wellesley College, and you said there that your tenure had prepared you to compete in the all boys club of presidential politics.\n\nAt the same time, your campaign has accused this all boys club surrounding you on stage of piling on with their attacks against you. And then your husband recently came to your defense by saying that these, quote, \"boys,\" had been getting rough with you -- (light laughter) -- and some have suggested that you, that your campaign, that your husband are exploiting gender as a political issue during this campaign.\n\nWhat's really going on here?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I'm not exploiting anything at all. I'm not playing, as some people say, the gender card here in Los Vegas. I'm just trying to play the winning card, and I understand well that -- (cheers, applause) -- people are not attacking me because I'm a woman. They're attacking me because I'm ahead, and I understand -- (interrupted by laughter, cheers) -- that -- you know, as Harry Truman famously said, \"If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.\" (Cheers.) And I feel very comfortable in the kitchen, and I'm going to -- (laughter) -- you know, withstand the heat.\n\nBut you know, this is really one of the kind of issues that we can laugh about because it's exciting when you look at this field of candidates.\n\nYou know, several of us would never have had a chance to stand here and run for president -- a Latino, an African American, a woman -- if it hadn't been for the progress of America over my lifetime. (Cheers, applause.) And I am thrilled to be running to be the first woman president.\n\nMS. BROWN: But Senator, if I can just ask you, what did you mean at Wellesley when you referred to the boys club?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, it is clear, I think, from women's experiences that from time to time, there may be some impediments. (Laughter.) And it has been my goal over the course of my lifetime to be part of this great movement of progress, that includes all of us but has particularly been significant to me as a woman. And to be able to aim toward the highest, hardest glass ceiling is history- making.\n\nNow, I'm not running because I'm a woman. I'm running because I think I'm the best qualified and experienced person to hit the ground running. (Cheers, applause.) But it's humbling. It's inspiring.\n\nAnd I have to tell you, as I travel around the country, you know, fathers drive hours to bring their daughters to my events. And so many women in their 90s wait to shake my hand. And they say something like, I'm 95 years old; I was born before women could vote, and I want to live long enough to see a woman in the White House.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\nWe're going to take a quick break, but I want to give all the boys up here -- (laughter) -- a chance to quickly respond, if any of them want to respond.\n\nDo any of you believe that Senator Clinton is playing the so- called gender card?\n\nMR. EDWARDS: I think -- are you looking at me? (Laughs.)\n\nMR. EDWARDS: I think that every single candidate on this stage should be held to exactly the same standard.\n\nI do believe, however, that the voters need to know that we have choices. There's nothing personal about this. I think there are very good people running in the Democratic Party for president, and we need to have a strong candidate in this presidential race.\n\nBut I think there are differences between us, and voters are entitled to know what those differences are without it being personal, without it being attack-oriented.\n\nI spoke earlier about the difference between corporate Democrats and corporate Republicans and how critical it is for us to give the power in the democracy back to the American people so we can give a better life to our children, as 20 generations before us have done.\n\nAnd my point is, some of us have taken a different approach to that. Senator Clinton defends the system, takes money from lobbyists, does all those things. And my point is simply that people have -- (chorus of boos) -- no, wait a minute. Voters have those choices. Voters have those choices. They deserve to know that they have those choices and that there are, in fact, differences between us. But I think every one of us should be held to the same standard.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. (Applause.) And thank you, all of you.\n\nWe're going to take a quick break. We have a lot more to do. We're going to readjust the stage up here, get some chairs. And when we come back, you're going to be hearing directly from voters here in Nevada. They're going to have a chance to ask these Democratic presidential candidates questions. (Applause.)\n\nMuch more of our Democratic presidential debate right here on the campus of the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. We'll be right back. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Welcome back. We're on the campus of the University of Nevada-Las Vegas in the Cox Pavilion. All the candidates are now seated. We're going to begin the second half of this presidential debate.\n\nOur White House correspondent, Suzanne Malveaux, is here with us. (Applause.) And Suzanne, you have some undecided voters who are ready to ask these presidential candidates some specific questions. Let's begin right now.\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: Sure, Wolf. They are all very excited, about a hundred folks here. I've had a chance to actually meet at least some of you here, and obviously I noticed when you were responding to some of the candidates you were shaking your head, wrinkling your nose. I'm not sure if they've answered your questions, and this is your opportunity to ask the candidates what you really care about.\n\nCatherine Jackson, I want to start off with you. If you'd stand with your son, please. Now, Catherine, I understand that you're quite concerned about your son, Christopher. You have served three tours of duty in Iraq, and you're -- (cheers, applause) -- recognize your service. (Extended cheers, applause.) That's for you, Christopher.\n\nYour mother, I spoke with her -- your mom -- is so worried that you're going to be called to duty again, but not to be deployed in Iraq, but rather Iran. Do you share her concern?\n\nCHRISTOPHER JACKSON: Yes, I do. And I feel that if we continue on the path we're at, that's where we're going to end up, in Iran. And that's not what our troops need. Our troops need to come home now. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: Catherine -- Catherine, your question.\n\nCATHERINE JACKSON: I finally got my son home after three tours of policing Iraq's civil war. Now members of the Bush administration and neoconservative members of Congress are beating the drums of war again. My son is still part of the Marine Individual Ready Reserve, and if President Bush starts another unnecessary war, there will be a chance that he'll likely be recalled for war.\n\nAll of you on the stage have either -- I'm sorry -- have formal political power or significant informal power, and have the ability to stop the rush to war.\n\nPlease tell me, how are you going to show us your leadership so -- on this issue now so I can decide who I think would be the best leader for tomorrow?\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: To Senator Biden, please.\n\nSEN. BIDEN: The way to do that, ma'am, is to not ratchet up the winds of war here. We had a vote in the United States Senate on declaring the Qods Force -- their special forces -- and the Revolutionary Guard to be a terrorist organization. A lot of people voted for that; 70 some voted for it. It's a serious, serious mistake because what it does, it was completely counterproductive. (Applause.)\n\nWhat it did was, ma'am, what it did was it convinced the rest of the Muslim world this is really a war against Islam and not a war in Iraq; and number two, it rose the -- it caused the price of oil to head to $100 a barrel. We're paying $30 a barrel for what they call a risk premium. And it helped destabilize the situation both in Iran -- I mean Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nSo the way to do this is to keep quiet, hush up, and do what I told the president personally and what I've said as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. If he takes the country to war in Iraq (sic) without a vote of Congress, which will not exist, then he should be impeached. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Senator Clinton, you voted for that resolution. You're the only one on the stage who did vote for that resolution. Do you want to respond --\n\nMR. BLITZER: -- to Senator Biden?\n\nSEN. BIDEN: I wasn't attacking Senator Clinton.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: No, no, no. No.\n\nMR. BLITZER: I know, but she did vote for the resolution.\n\nBut if you could address this young man and his mother --\n\nMR. BLITZER: -- about their fear that because of your vote, he might have to go fight in Iran.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, there is no basis for that fear. There is, however, a deep concern that is well justified about this president. That’s why what I tried to do is oppose a rush to war. I started speaking out against it back in February because I was worried about President Bush, working with members of Congress to do exactly what Joe is saying, which is to make it absolutely clear there is no legal authority whatsoever.\n\nBut what I think is most important is that we have aggressive diplomacy with Iran. I believe that the Bush administration has allowed this situation to worsen and fester because they won’t have any diplomatic relations of any sort with Iran. So I would do is to immediately begin that kind of negotiation, and I wouldn’t ask the Iranians to give up their quest for nuclear power or anything else. Get them to the table. Let’s figure out if there’s some way we can, number one, ratchet down the tension; number two, prevent them from becoming a nuclear weapons power because that would be dangerous for all of us; and get the rest of the world to help us. We need China and Russia, the neighbors in the region. That’s what I would be doing.\n\nThe only thing I would add, in addition to thanking you for your service, is that having been in Iraq you know that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard has assisted the militias and others in killing our Americans and in maiming them. They have imported technology and technical assistance. I believe they are a terrorist group. I think --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- sanctioning them and putting some pressure on them is an important part of getting to the diplomatic table with both carrots and sticks.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: So oppose the rush to war, but get tough and have a diplomatic approach to Iran.\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right, I want to hear from Senator Edwards first. Go ahead. Senator, do you accept her explanation, this was no vote for a rush to war with Iran?\n\nMR. EDWARDS: Well, let me say, can I just say first, Christopher, thank you. God bless you for what you did for us and for America. Men and women like you have served this country so courageously. And I’m proud of both you and your mom being here to speak up, because I think this is such a crucial issue for the future of the country.\n\nMy own view is that it’s important for us to stop Bush, Cheney and the neocons at every single stage. And I think there was an important opportunity to do that on the vote on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Bush, Cheney and the neocons wanted the Iranian Revolutionary Guard declared a terrorist group, as Senator Biden just spoke about, because it’s part of their path to moving militarily on Iran.\n\nAnd actually the fear a lot of us had about that was realized about a week ago, when Bush, Cheney and the administration declared the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization, and this is the part everyone’s going to love, a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction. (Jeers.) We’ve seen this movie. We know how it turns out. And I think it is absolutely crucial for Democrats on this issue to show real strength, real backbone, and stop this president from moving forward on Iran. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, Chris, we appreciate your service, and your mom, I can only imagine what she went through when you were away, so we're glad you're back home.\n\nBut understand the problem with this vote on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. It wasn't simply that it was identified as a terrorist organization. It was also that in the language of the resolution it said we should maintain our forces in Iraq with an eye towards blunting Iranian influence. So it's not just going to have an impact in terms of potentially having a war against Iran. It also gives this administration an excuse to perpetuate their failed strategy in Iraq, and that could mean that you could be redeployed in Iraq. That's why this was a mistake, and that's why not only do we have to bring the war in Iraq to a close, but we have to change the mindset that got us into war, which means we initiate -- yes, I agree with Hillary that we've got to initiate bold diplomacy. I think the next president has to lead that diplomacy. It can't just be envoys.\n\nAnd one of the reasons I'm running for president -- and Hillary and I had a disagreement on this. I said I would meet with not just our friends, but also with our enemies because that's what strong countries and -- (cheers, applause) -- what strong presidents do is meet with our adversaries, tell them where we stand. (Continued applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Senator, I want to go back to Suzanne Malveaux, but this was an important vote, and you missed that vote. You weren't present in the Senate when that vote occurred.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: No, this is true. And it was a mistake. This is one of the hazards of running for president. But the -- but what I've -- but what I have consistently said, and I said at the time of the vote, was that we should not take steps that would increase troop presences inside Iraq with an eye towards blunting the impact of Iran. I always think that's a mistake.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: Jeannie (sp) Jackson, if you would stand for us, please. You have something in common with the other mother. You have a son that's also in Iraq. But your question, your concern is very different. What is your question?\n\nJEANNIE (sp) JACKSON: Well, I think you're all about getting us out of Iraq, and I appreciate, so it may be a moot point. But my son's making $30,000 while corporate people are making, minimum, $100,000 for going over there. Is there any way to end this disparity in wages?\n\nAnd also, I'd like to say to Bill Richardson: Happy Birthday. (Laughter, applause.) Thank you.\n\nMS. BLITZER: Let's throw the question to the birthday boy. (Laughter.)\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: Okay, I guess he gets the gift here. And obviously, we're talking about private contractors. Governor Richardson, you know that Senator Obama has said he would pull out all of the private contractors if in fact that he was president. But in light of how stretched our military is, do you think that's a practical solution?\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Yes. I would pull out all the contractors. (Cheers, applause.) I would get them all out, just like I would get all our troops out, all residual forces. And I would do it within a year.\n\nJEANNIE (sp) JACKSON: Great answer.\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Here's my answer.\n\nWhat I believe we need to do is we need to reform our military. This is what I would do.\n\nThis war in Iraq has bled us enormously, has bled our military enormously. I would find ways to keep the all-volunteer force. Now, I would say to you that I would have two more divisions in the Army, two more in the Marines. I would increase military pay and educational benefits, a new G.I. Bill for our military. (Applause.)\n\nBut what I would also do is with our veterans, you know, and military families. I would have a heroes health card for every military person in this country -- (applause) -- which would mean that they could get health care, not just at the VA system but anywhere they want. I would fully guarantee funding at the VA.\n\nAnd most importantly the big, big challenge is mental health. We don't treat mental health with the parity that this country deserves. And our kids coming back from Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam -- there's a huge burden, mental trauma, traumatic brain injury, PTSD. And we have a VA system and we have a mental health system in this country that is not given the parity, the coverage that it deserves.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you, Governor. Thank you.\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: Our next question -- Khalil Khan, if you would just please stand for a moment.\n\nYou and I spoke very briefly, and you said you have some concerns about racial profiling.\n\nKHALIL KHAN: Yes, I do.\n\nI'm American citizen and have been profiled all the time at the airport. Since 9/11, hundreds of thousands Americans have been profiled. And you know that it is like harassment. And my question is that, that our civil liberties have been taken away from us.\n\nWhat you are going to do to protect Americans from this kind of harassment?\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: Senator Edwards, we'd like you to take that. You obviously voted for the Patriot Act, which gives the government extended powers of surveillance. What do you say to people like Mr. Khan, who say he's been abused by that power?\n\nMR. EDWARDS: I say he's right, he's right, and this administration has done more than abuse the Patriot Act. And the Patriot Act needs to be dramatically changed, by the way. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nBut in addition to that, the racial profiling that you're describing has to be stopped, and it will be stopped when I'm president of the United States. And we're going to take the steps that need to be taken to restore America's moral leadership in the world, and that means a whole group of things: stopping the profiling, stopping the illegal -- and I use that term intentionally -- the illegal spying on the American people that this president has been engaged in -- (cheers, applause) -- closing Guantanamo, which I think is a national embarrassment -- (cheers, applause) -- no more secret prisons, no more rendition.\n\nAnd it's just absolutely amazing to me that there's actually an open discussion in the United States of America about what kind of torture will be tolerated. I'll tell you what kind of torture will be tolerated when I'm president of the United States, no torture will be tolerated when I'm president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\nMR. EDWARDS: We're going to restore our respect in the world.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Congressman Kucinich, I believe you're the only person on this stage who had a chance to vote on the Patriot Act right after 9/11, who voted against it right away.\n\nREP. KUCINICH: That's because I read it. (Laughter, cheers.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Now, here's the question, here's the question. (Continued cheers.) Here's the question: Congressman, do you feel, as you've felt on other issues, that those who voted for the Patriot Act -- and there are several here on this stage -- bear a responsibility for the way this individual, this American citizen, is being treated when he goes through an airport?\n\nREP. KUCINICH: I -- you're owed an apology. You really are. And every American should be able to present themselves without having to be further scrutinized based on ethnic identity.\n\nBut let's go back to the point that you made here. The time -- you know, the president of the United States is called upon to make the right decision at the right time. And you've seen here tonight people who voted for the war, voted to fund the war, and now they have a different position; people who voted for the Patriot Act, now they have a different position; people who voted for China trade, now they have a different position; people who voted for Yucca Mountain, now they had a different position. Just imagine what it will be like to have a president of the United States who's right the first time. Just imagine. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAnd -- and I don't think -- I don't think that the first questioner's question was really answered, about what are you going to do about this president, and for that matter the vice president, because they're out of control and the Congress isn't doing anything. (Applause.) I --\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Congressman.\n\nREP. KUCINICH: It's called impeachment, and you don't wait. You do it now. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nREP. KUCINICH: You don't wait. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Suzanne got -- Suzanne has another question.\n\nREP. KUCINICH: Now. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: But I want --\n\nREP. KUCINICH: Impeach them now.\n\nMR. BLITZER: -- Senator Biden to go ahead and respond because you voted for the Patriot Act.\n\nSEN. BIDEN: You know, let's -- facts are a funny thing; they get in the way. (Laughter.) You know what I mean?\n\nThere is nothing in the Patriot Act that allows profiling. Let's get that straight.\n\nNothing in the Patriot Act allows profiling, number one. You're profiled illegally. I have voted against and worked with legislation with many people on this stage to stop profiling. That's number one. It did not. It's not because of the Patriot Act. It's a convenient thing to talk about, number one.\n\nNumber two, you know, when we had a chance to close down Guantanamo, I voted against funding Guantanamo. Other folks up here voted for funding it, including the two leading candidates. I voted to not build the new $36 million part. I called for closing it three years ago.\n\nAnd so folks, this -- but this is not about who was right when, it's what's your plan now? What are you going to do now? (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Senator.\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: George Ambriz. He's -- you're a graduate student here, and you're also a mentor for children. I understand that you have a concern about immigration.\n\nQ Yes, I do. (Speaks in Spanish.) It seems that many political commentators such as Lou Dobbs are guiding the debate and strongly shaping U.S. policy on immigration by insinuating a linkage to terrorism. As many people know, no terrorist has come from our southern border. Do you consider fighting terrorism and slowing the flow of illegal immigration coming from our southern border as intrinsically related issues?\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: Governor Richardson, since you're the only on this stage who does not support even building a fence, why don't you take this one?\n\nREP. KUCINICH: That's not true.\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: By the way, Dennis, you keep -- stop including me in all these votes. I've been a governor. I'm in New Mexico. (Laughter.) I'm not in Washington. (Applause.)\n\nHere's my answer. You know, two years ago -- and I'm the only one that's dealt with the immigration issue directly.\n\nYou know, and by the way, with the Congress, let me just say, the Congress's approval rating is 11 percent. Now, you know who's higher? Dick Cheney and HMOs. (Laughter.)\n\nMy point is that, you know, let's talk about the need to bring this together. Dysfunctional relationships exist between the president and the Congress that needs to be corrected.\n\nHere's my answer. Two years ago, I'm the first governor that declared a border emergency because the federal government wasn't doing its job in stopping the flow of drugs and people. But you know what? We should stop demonizing immigrants. We should stop doing that. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I'm against the fence -- and I am against the fence because it will not work. The Congress only funded half of the fence, and it's not America.\n\nWhat I would do is I would do four quick things. One, we have to secure the border. Double the number of Border Patrol agents. Keep the National Guard there a little longer; detection equipment, as you mentioned.\n\nSecondly, those that knowingly hire illegal workers should be punished. (Applause.)\n\nThird, we should have a relationship -- it's called foreign policy -- with Mexico. They're our friend. But we should speak frankly to our friends, and it should be something like this. \"Mexico, give jobs to your people.\" (Cheers, applause.) \"You know, at the very least, stop handing out maps on the easiest place to cross.\" (Laughter.) And then, lastly, a legalization plan -- a legalization plan --\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: -- not amnesty, not citizenship, but a path to legalization that involves conditions -- learning English --\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: -- paying back taxes.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Governor, thank you.\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: This is a very important issue.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Very important. I want Senator Dodd, though, to respond, because you voted for that security fence along the border between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nSEN. DODD: Well, first of all -- (speaks in Spanish). (Cheers, applause.)\n\nI was in the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic.\n\nI argued at some points that fence, at certain places, you could make a case that a wall might help; not across the entire border. I'm opposed to that, but the idea of having some sort of better security, including additional guards, additional technology here that would allow us to deal with the issues. But there ought not to be any correlation here.\n\nWhen you take the oath of office, you don't swear to uphold the Constitution or protect the country. I believe by upholding our rights, we do protect the country. And the administration has taken the opposite view. They're posing to us the false choice, the dichotomy that to be safer, we have to give up rights. I think that's so fundamentally flawed and fundamentally dangerous for the United States of America to (embrace ?) that idea. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right, thank you, Senator.\n\nLet's go back to Suzanne.\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: We have Judy Bagley here with us; if you would stand for a moment. You have been working in the casino business for some 27 years now, a cashier.\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: You've seen a lot of people come and go, obviously.\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: What is your concern?\n\nMS. BAGLEY: I'm a booth cashier. And we moved here over 30 years ago. And I have three children, and as of yesterday, eight grandchildren. (Applause.)\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: And what is your question -- congratulations. That's amazing. And what is your question to the candidates?\n\nMS. BAGLEY: My question is, over the next several years the baby boomers, like my husband and I, will be retiring en masse. At the same time, the country is at a record deficit. We face a major challenge. When I retire, I will have my pension, but many others will not.\n\nThroughout the campaign we've heard the candidates supporting -- committing to support -- oh, my goodness -- committing to support Social Security and Medicare. My question is -- but the ideas on reform are often vague. My question is, what do you plan to do to ensure that Social Security and Medicare are truly available to us, our children and grandchildren in light of the current budget conditions?\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: Thank you very much; a very important issue.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, first of all, Judy, thank you for the question, and thanks for the great work you do on behalf of the culinary workers; a great union here. (Applause.)\n\nLook, this is something that we've talked about in our campaign. We've got 78 million baby boomers who are going to be retiring and the first thing we have to do is to put an end to George Bush raiding the Social Security trust fund to pay for a misguided war in Iraq. (Applause.) If we take some of that money back and we start getting control of our budget and have fiscal discipline, that will make some of the difference, but not all of it, because we're going to have more senior citizens, more retirees and fewer workers.\n\nSo I've been very specific about saying that we should not privatize; we should protect benefits. I don't think the best way to approach this is to raise the retirement age. But what we can do is adjust the cap on the payroll tax. Right now anybody who's making $97,000 or less, you pay payroll tax on 100 percent of your income. Warren Buffet, who made $46 million last year, pays on a fraction of 1 percent of his income. And if we make that small adjustment, we can potentially close that gap and we can make sure Social Security is there. (Applause.)\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Last point because -- just because I have to answer the full question.\n\nMedicare is a tougher problem because we've got health care inflation going up, and I am meeting people all across the country who just can't manage, even if they've got health insurance. Their premiums have gone up 78 percent since George Bush took office. It's a scam, and people are getting desperate.\n\nThe only way we're going to fix Medicare is if we get that rising cost under control, and that means having a universal health care plan where every single person has prevention and they are able to get the treatments they need. We're instituting health technologies and managing the chronically ill so that we save money; we provide coverage for everybody. That over the long term will save Medicare enormous amounts of money, and it will be there for you.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\nSenator Clinton, you've been criticized by Senator Obama, I think Senator Edwards, among others, for refusing to take a hard and fast position on whether you would raise the tax above those making $97,500 dollars a year to try to secure Social Security in the long term. Are you ready to make a hard and fast statement now on your position on what Senator Obama just said?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I'll tell you what I'm for, and I think Judy raises two really important issues. I am for getting back to fiscal responsibility. I think I counted you said \"deficit\" three times. Six and a half years ago when George Bush came into office, he inherited a balanced budget and a surplus -- (applause) -- and the Social Security system was on a path to be solvent into 2055.\n\nWe have long-term challenges with Social Security. We have a crisis with Medicare, just like we have a crisis with health care costs. We have a crisis with energy costs. We have a lot of very intense challenges we have to meet right now. So what I want to do is move back toward fiscal responsibility. I think if we don't do that, we're not going to deal with any of these problems adequately. Then I think we will demonstrate that we're serious about getting our house in order again --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- and then I think we have to have a bipartisan commission. I do not want to fix the problems of Social Security on the backs of middle class families and seniors. (Applause.) If you lift the cap completely, that is a $1 trillion tax increase. I don't think we need to do that.\n\nBut I want to say one final word about Medicare. Number one, Medicare should be able to negotiate for lower drug prices. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right. Thank you, Senator.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: It was a travesty when the Bush administration did not allow that to happen, and I have a lot of other ideas about how we'll preserve and strengthen Medicare.\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right. So Senator -- so you're not ready to accept that raising of the cap on that, but I know that Senator Obama wants to respond to you.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I will be very brief on this because, Hillary, I've heard you say this is a trillion dollar tax cut on the middle class by adjusting the cap. Understand that only 6 percent of Americans make more than $97,000 -- (cheers, applause) -- so 6 percent is not the middle class -- it's the upper class.\n\nAnd you know, this is the kind of thing that I would expect from Mitt Romney or Rudy Giuliani -- (laughter, boos, cheers, applause) -- where we start playing with numbers -- we start playing with numbers in order to try to make a point. (Cheers, applause.) And we can't do that. No, no, no, no, no. This is -- this is -- this is too important. This is too important for us to pretend that we're using numbers like a trillion dollar tax cut instead of responsibly dealing with a problem that Judy asked for, and she said she wants a specific answer. And that's what I provided.\n\nBut understand, this is the top 6 percent, and that is not the middle class. (Cheers, applause.) MR. BLITZER: Senator?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: First of all -- first of all, I think that you meant a tax increase, because that's what it would be. But secondly, it is absolutely the case that there are people who would find that burdensome. I represent firefighters. I represent school supervisors. I'm not talking -- I mean, you know, it's different parts of the country. So you have to look at this across the board, and the numbers are staggering.\n\nNow, when people say be specific, I listened very carefully to what Senator Obama said when he appeared on one of the Sunday morning shows, and he basically said that he was for looking at a lot of different things and using a bipartisan commission to do it. I think that's the right answer. That is where I have been from the very beginning.\n\nThat's what worked back in 1983, when we had a real crisis in Social Security. The government got together. President Reagan and Speaker Tip O'Neill put together a bipartisan commission. Then everybody looked at everything at once. It wasn't one person's idea or somebody else's idea. Everybody had to get in a room and say, here's what we're going to do to fix the problem. That's what I want to do because I think that's what will work for America. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: I want everybody to stand by because we have a lot more to talk about, a lot more of these questions from undecided voters here in Nevada. But we're going to take a quick commercial break. Much more from the campus of the University of Nevada-Las Vegas right after this. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Welcome back to the campus of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. We're at the Democratic presidential debate. Suzanne Malveaux's got another undecided voter with a question.\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: LaShannon Spencer, please stand up for a moment. What is your question?\n\nLASHANNON SPENCER: We constantly hear health care questions and questions pertaining to the war. But we don't hear questions pertaining to the Supreme Court justice or education. (Applause.)\n\nMy question is, if you are elected president, what qualities must the appointee possess?\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: I'd like to get to Senator Dodd, if you would. And in answering that question, also tell us whether or not you would require your nominees to support abortion rights.\n\nSEN. DODD: Well, first of all, you want -- first of all, thanks for your question.\n\nWell, obviously you want people here that are going to have a balanced sense of justice, to bring a life experience to that bench, where they're not just there as academics, that have a clear record in the judicial branch, where they either served as a judge or as a lawyer, where they've demonstrated that ability to be fair and just when it comes to the administration of laws of our country here.\n\nI don't necessarily believe in applying litmus tests here. I think that's a dangerous precedent to begin that process here. You start down that path, others may follow. You end up with a court then that may lack that kind of balance.\n\nNow, obviously as someone who's pro-choice and have been, entire public life and career, I feel very strongly about Roe versus Wade.\n\nI would not want a justice to be appointed who would even think about overturning that. (Applause.)\n\nBut I want to be very careful here -- I want to be careful about making sure that I'd know the person, I'm not just looking at people I don't know or don't understand their background, so I have a very good feel of where they're going to be on these matters. (Inaudible) -- when they make the statement that they will uphold precedent, and they raise their right hand before the Judiciary Committee and make that commitment and then violate that commitment, that I find highly offensive. That will not happen in a Dodd administration, I promise you. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right, let's go through the whole panel. I want everybody to weigh in. This is an important question that was raised. I'll start with Senator Biden.\n\nWould you insist that any nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court supported abortion rights for women?\n\nSEN. BIDEN: Suzanne's decided. I'm not answering her question. I'm answering the question of the woman who is there. Okay? (Cheers, applause.) And -- number one. And then I'll answer Suzanne's question.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Well, let's ask the woman. Do you want him to answer that question?\n\nSEN. BIDEN: Do you want me to answer your question?\n\nMS. SPENCER: I would like for you to answer both questions.\n\nSEN. BIDEN: I will answer both. I'll answer your question first. Your question first, is I've presided over more Supreme Court justices than anyone in American history, number one.\n\nNumber two, I have taken on those justices who in fact show no balance. They are ideologues. We have enough ideologues. We have enough professors on the bench. We have enough -- I want a someone who ran for dog catcher. I want someone -- (laughter) -- literally. Not a joke. When Hillary's husband asked me for his advice when he was appointing people, I wanted to go to people, and so did he. We couldn't -- four people turned it down.\n\nWe wanted to get someone who in fact had -- knew what it was like to live life, knew what it was as not some intellectual feat. (Applause.)\n\nAnd by the way, the next person that's appointed on a Biden administration is going to be a woman. We don't have enough women on the bench, number one.\n\nSEN. BIDEN: Number two, Suzanne Malveaux's question. I would not appoint anyone who did not understand that Section 5 of the 14th Amendment and the Liberty Clause of the 14th Amendment provided a right to privacy. That's the question I'd ask them. (Applause.) If that is answered correctly, that that is the case, then it answers the question, which means they would support Roe v. Wade. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Let's go down the whole panel, and if you could give me a short yes or no; would you insist on a Supreme Court nominee supporting abortion?\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: I would have diversity as a prime criterion, but I would also ask my nominee -- this is what I would ask: Number one, do you believe Roe versus Wade is settled law? Number two, do you support the right to privacy? Number three, do you support civil rights? Number four, do you support -- (what you asked ?) -- education, school equalization?\n\nIf the answer is no to those questions that basically say is it settled law or not -- you want to call it a litmus test, fine -- those would be the judges that I would appoint for the Supreme Court. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right. Thank you, Governor.\n\nREP. KUCINICH: A Kucinich appointment to the Supreme Court would have a litmus test on abortion. It's a -- it's a question of a woman's right to choose and a right to privacy.\n\nBut a president has to do more than that. A president has to be a healer, and this has been one of the great divides in our country. And so I want to also let the American people know that I'll stand for prenatal care, postnatal care, child care, a living wage, universal health care, sex education --\n\nREP. KUCINICH: -- birth control. We can make abortions less necessary if we have a healer in the White House, and we can also protect a woman's right to choose. We can do both. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\nSenator Clinton, would this be a sine qua non for you, that any nominee you name to the Supreme Court would have to share your view on abortion?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, they'd have to share my view about privacy, and I think that goes hand in hand. Privacy, in my opinion, is embedded in our Constitution. What does it mean to have a right to free speech or the right to worship as you choose if you also don't have the right to be left alone, to have that privacy that goes with being an American? (Applause.) So it would be absolutely critical.\n\nAnd I, like Senator Biden --\n\nMR. BLITZER: So the answer is yes?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Yes, the answer is yes. And --\n\nMR. BLITZER: Okay. All right.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: But I -- I just want to say, Senator Biden really deserves a lot of plaudits because he knows this issue forwards and backwards. And I think it's important to have a president who understands the intricate connections of our branches of government and the Constitution.\n\nI think that's one of the great tragedies of George Bush's presidency is he didn't really understand the way our government was supposed to work. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nSenator Obama, you used to be a professor of law.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I would not appoint somebody who doesn't believe in the right to privacy. But you're right, Wolf, I taught constitutional law for 10 years, and I -- when you look at what makes a great Supreme Court justice, it's not just the particular issue and how they rule, but it's their conception of the court. And part of the role of the court is that it is going to protect people who may be vulnerable in the political process, the outsider, the minority, those who are vulnerable, those who don't have a lot of clout. (Applause.)\n\nAnd part of what I want to find in a Supreme Court justice -- and Joe's exactly right, sometimes we're only looking at academics or people who've been in the court. If we can find people who have life experience and they understand what it means to be on the outside, what it means to have the system not work for them, that's the kind of person I want on the Supreme Court. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Senator.\n\nWe heard from Senator Dodd, so Senator Edwards, go ahead. Would you insist that nominees support abortion?\n\nMR. EDWARDS: I would insist that they recognize the right to privacy and recognize Roe v. Wade as settled law. But I want to go beyond what some others have said here because it is so crucial if you grew up like I did in the segregated style and you saw how important it was to have federal judges who had some backbone and were willing to stand up against popular opinion -- but we had a judge who desegregated the public schools in North Carolina, in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nHe literally had to have armed guards take him from home to work and home each day. That's the kind of courage and strength we need in a United States Supreme Court justice.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: Frank Perconte is a student here.\n\nFrank, what is your question?\n\nFRANK PERCONTE: Whether it's the continuing violence in Iraq, or if it's a potential confrontation with Iran, or even the emerging instability in Pakistan, nothing seems to be getting any better in the Middle East. It only seems to be getting worse. And if the upcoming election is anything like the last two elections, if any of you is elected, in all likelihood, you'll be presiding over an extremely divided electorate. Almost half the country is not going to agree with you on the direction you want to take this country to meet those challenges in the Middle East.\n\nSo my question to you is, assuming you are elected, the day after you take the oath of office, what message will you offer the whole country, to unite all of us behind you, so that you can see us through this period of transition that we're in? (Applause.)\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: I'd like to refer that to Senator Obama.\n\nSenator Obama, you said on a TV interview just this past weekend, you didn't believe that Senator Clinton was able to unite this country. Why do you believe she can't?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: No, that's not what I said. What I said was I thought I could do it better. That's why I'm running for president. (Applause.) If I didn't think I could do it better then I wouldn't be running for president, because the stakes are too high, just as we heard.\n\nHere's what I would do immediately. I would convene a continuous advisory meeting, with not just Democrats but Republicans, specifically on national security issues, because there is a long tradition that our differences in foreign policy should end at the water's edge.\n\nAnd we have lost that tradition. And there are some wonderful Republicans -- Dick Lugar, Chuck Hagel -- there are a group of them who have continued that tradition, but we have lost it because of the polarization of the Bush administration.\n\nSo I want Republicans and Democrats and independents to understand that, as president, I am going to want to go before the entire world and say, America's back, we are ready to lead. But we're not just going to lead militarily; we're going to lead by building schools in the Middle East that teach math and science instead of hatred of Americans. We're going to lead by shutting down Guantanamo and restoring habeas corpus in this country so that we offer them an example. (Applause.)\n\nSEN. OBAMA: We're going to lead by talking to our enemies and not just our friends.\n\nAnd I believe that there are a lot of Republicans who hunger for that kind of bipartisan approach. That's what I will offer as president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Senator Clinton -- thank you, Senator -- some have suggested, including some on this stage, that you are simply too polarizing to unite the country if you were elected president. What do you say to those critics?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I say that I am running to be the president of the entire country. You know, when I started running for the Senate in New York, I heard the same things.\n\nAnd what I did was to reach out to Republicans, Democrats, independents, rural, urban because we've got to begin to work together. That's what I've tried to do in the Senate working across party lines, trying to find common ground; to go back to Chris, you know, working to get health care for Guard and Reservists with a colleague, a Republican colleague from South Carolina. You know, you have to look to find common ground, and it is the responsibility of a leader to try to make that possible.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean there won't be differences because there are. We're not going to wake up the day after the election and not believe what we believe and not see the world as we see it, but we can certainly begin under presidential leadership to listen to one another, to look for those chances to find that common ground and work together. That's the kind of president I will be, and I will spend a lot of my time working with not just Republicans, but people who aren't in public life. We've got smart people all over this country who want to make a contribution, who want to give something back. Let's enlist the best that we have in America and start acting like Americans again to solve our problems and make a difference, Wolf. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\nSEN. BIDEN: Let me give you a direct answer to your question. I'd start by ending the war, and I've already gained the respect of my Republican colleagues; the only person that's gotten 75 votes in the United States Senate on a plan to end the war.\n\nIt's sitting in a drawer. It'll begin the day that I get elected.\n\nSecondly, one of the ways you work in the House and the Senate is over time you gain respect. Find me a Republican on the other side that doesn't respect my judgment and doesn't think I tell them straight up the truth. I've worked with them. I've already done it. I would also include Republicans in my administration. Look, the basic premise you operate on, I reject. The vast majority of Republicans think this war stinks as well. The vast majority of Republicans out there think that our foreign policy is shambles. The vast majority of the Independents think that.\n\nFolks, this is not going to be that hard. This is like not -- this isn't pushing the rope. They're sticking with George Bush out of loyalty, but I promise you I've already brought them along. I brought them along on Bosnia under the administration of Senator Clinton -- of President Clinton. I brought them along on the issue of dealing with arms control. I brought them along on the issue of the war in Iraq.\n\nSEN. BIDEN: -- buy into this premise that Republicans -- average Republicans and Republican senators don't agree to this, they do. They're afraid to take on Bush. I will end that. I've already done it, and I would start with ending the war in Iraq with 75 senators -- (off mike). (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right. Thank you, Senator.\n\nWe're going to go back to Suzanne, but go ahead, Governor Richardson, very briefly.\n\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Well, you know, tonight we've talked about Iran, we've talked about Iraq, we've talked about regimes that have not been friendly. I'd thrown in North Korea.\n\nThe cornerstone of my foreign policy would be diplomacy and negotiation.\n\nWe would be not the world's policemen but the world's conscience. All my life as an ambassador to the United Nations, as a special envoy, I've brought people together -- as a governor, bipartisan solutions, as a congressmen, as a secretary of Energy.\n\nI'm going to answer your question specifically on the Middle East. Number one, I would have a Middle East peace envoy. This president's the only president that hasn't had one. I would base a Middle East settlement on a two-state solution: protection for the security of Israel and a Palestinian state.\n\nI would also look at adjustments in the '67 borders. I would also look at dealing effectively and efficiently and fairly with the settlements issue, with Jerusalem. I would do something else. I would talk to Syria. I would talk to Iran.\n\nIt's all tied in a solution. It's called leadership and diplomacy. And to take these steps, you have to be bold. We're talking about electing a president that is going to need to repair the enormous damage of this administration in the last eight years.\n\nMR. BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: Maria, would you stand, please? Give us your full name.\n\nQ Maria -- (inaudible) -- and I'm a UNLV student. And my question is for Senator Clinton. This is a fun question for you. Do you prefer diamonds or pearls? (Laughter.)\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Now, I know I'm sometimes accused of not being able to make a choice. I want both. (Laughter.)\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: Do we get to ask any of the other candidates or, I suppose, just Senator Clinton? (Cross talk.)\n\nQ It's the only thing shiny up there.\n\nMS. MALVEAUX: Okay, thank you so much.\n\nMR. BLITZER: All right, so on that note, diamonds and pearls, I want to thank all of the Democratic presidential candidates for joining us here this evening. Let's give them a big round of applause. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nThat wraps up our debate tonight. This is the first presidential debate ever held here in the state of Nevada. We'd like to thank our hosts here at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and the Nevada Democratic Party, for all their help and all their volunteers in putting this together.\n\nThe next debate, by the way, in the race for the White House, will be in less than two weeks here on CNN, the long-awaited Republican YouTube presidential debate in St. Petersburg, Florida. Anderson Cooper, he'll be moderating that debate, and we're going to hand over the program right now to Anderson Cooper to pick up our coverage.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nMR. BLITZER: Let me bring in Senator Obama, because you’ve been among those critical of Senator Clinton. You’ve suggested she’s triangulating, whatever that means, on some of the key issues; she’s running a textbook Washington campaign, you’ve suggested that."}
{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00005-of-00064--253", "original_text": "It was just one line slipped into the middle of a paragraph of Mitt Romney’s speech on April 3 celebrating his primary victories in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia: “And the most vulnerable have been hurt the most — over 30 percent of single moms are struggling in poverty.”\n\nSeemingly unremarkable, these 19 words represent one of the many steps Romney will be taking as he treks back to the center in the aftermath of a primary campaign dominated by the hard right. It was only two months ago, after all, that Romney told CNN: “I’m not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there.”\n\nWithout drawing attention to his rhetorical shift, Romney, in a speech on March 30 at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisc., abandoned his attack on President Obama’s “entitlement society,” faulting Obama’s “government-centered society” instead.\n\nThere is a powerful rationale behind this shift.\n\nIn the primaries, Romney’s target audience was well to the right of the mainstream and deeply hostile to the notion of entitlement programs. In the minds of many conservatives, such programs are direct transfer payments from “hard-working” better-off citizens to the “undeserving poor.” Denouncing Obama’s “entitlement society” played well to angry Republican primary voters.\n\nIn the general election, however, voters are less inclined to adopt hostile views of redistributive government programs. Instead, many are likely to understand – and if they don’t, Democrats will remind them – that the biggest entitlement programs are Social Security and Medicare, life support for large numbers of the elderly. Romney will have to carry a strong majority of voters over 65 if he is to win. His revamped phrasing reduces the risk of alienating this constituency.\n\nRomney has roughly five months until Labor Day — the traditional beginning of the general election season — to redefine himself as a candidate more attractive to independent and swing voters.\n\nEven on immigration – the issue he used to great effect to blunt last winter’s challenge from the governor of Texas, Rick Perry – Romney is now modulating his stance in hopes of muting Hispanic antagonism.\n\nRather than reiterating his tough policies on illegal immigration and undocumented immigrants, Romney, addressing a town hall meeting at the Moore Oil Company in Milwaukee on April 2, attacked Obama for failing to live up to his promise to win approval of immigration reform legislation.\n\n“This has always been a priority for the president, [but one that] he chooses to do nothing about,” Romney told supporters. “Let the immigrant community not forget that while he uses this as a political weapon, he has not taken responsibility for fixing the problems we have.”\n\nRomney then used ingeniously ambiguous language that lends itself to multiple interpretations, including the idea that he just might be open to finding a way for illegal immigrants to stay in the United States:\n\nThis will be a priority of mine, if I become president, to make sure we finally reform our immigration laws step by step, secure the border, improve our legal immigration system, so we can keep people here and welcome people here who will make America a stronger nation.\n\nNotice that “so we can keep people here.” For those interested in the subtle movement of politicians away from the ideological extremes they advocate while primaries are underway, the most interesting part of the Romney transition is almost certain to start very soon.\n\nRomney is now signaling a modest level of empathy — along the lines of the compassion Perry displayed last September 22 when he told his fellow candidates at a debate that “if you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state for other reason than they have been brought there by no fault of their own, I don’t think you have a heart.”\n\nRecall that on Sept. 23, one day after Perry spoke, Romney shot back, “if you’re opposed to illegal immigration, it doesn’t mean that you don’t have a heart. It means that you have a heart and a brain.”\n\nRomney’s newly found heart suggests that his brain is telling him that Hispanic voters could be crucial on Election Day.\n\nFavoring baby steps, as politicians routinely do to prevent voters from noticing giant leaps over time, Romney is about to embark on an effort to blur positions he took in his primary battles with Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, especially his controversial stands on such issues as women’s health and access to contraception.\n\nIn a nomination fight dominated by Tea Party supporters and the Christian Right, an unexpected litmus test emerged: any Republican candidate who wanted to remain competitive had to support an amendment sponsored by Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, allowing employers to opt out of covering contraception for women in their company’s health insurance plans if the employer is morally or ethically opposed to the use of birth control.\n\nRomney initially indicated, on Feb. 29, that he opposed the legislation.\n\n“I’m not for the bill, but look, the idea of presidential candidates getting into questions about contraception within a relationship between a man and a women, husband and wife, I’m not going there,” Romney said, adding, “Contraception is working just fine, let’s just leave it alone.”\n\nLater the same day, as soon as his campaign staff learned of these comments, however, they released a statement declaring, “Governor Romney supports the Blunt Bill because he believes in a conscience exemption in health care for religious institutions and people of faith.”\n\nThen, on March 13, Romney provoked a media firestorm when he told St. Louis TV station KSDK, “You get rid of Obamacare, but there are others. Planned Parenthood, we’re gonna get rid of that.” Planned Parenthood provides healthcare services for women generally, including contraception and abortions.\n\nNearly three weeks later, on April 2, Romney acknowledged that he has a problem with some women voters. Campaigning in Middleton, Wisc., he declared:\n\nWe have work, we have work to do, to make sure we take our message to the women of America, so they understand how we’re going to get good jobs and we’re going to have a bright economic future for them and for their kids, and make sure that these distortions that the Democrats throw in are clarified and the truth is heard.\n\nIn a March 29 Pew Poll, Romney was losing to Obama among women by 20 points, 58-38. Among white women, a group he must carry by at least 10 points to win in November, he was just breaking even with Obama, 48-48.\n\nThere is an ongoing debate over whether Romney’s comments about shutting down Planned Parenthood and his endorsement of the Blunt amendment directly influenced women voters, but there is no doubt that women are demonstrating an aversion to his campaign and to the Republican Party.\n\nA March 24-25 CNN/ORC International survey showed the following: In a head-to-head match up, Obama led Romney by 16 points, 56-40, among all voters. The Democrat held a smaller, 10-point advantage among men, 53-43, and a landslide level of support among women, 60-37, or 23-points.\n\nWhen voters were asked if they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Romney, unfavorable trumped favorable by 12 points, 49-37. Among men, this fell to 10 points, 50-40, while among women the unfavorable ratings were 14 points higher than the favorable ones, 48-34.\n\nIn the case of Obama, the numbers were reversed. Among all voters, a 14-point majority, 56-42, viewed him favorably. Among men this fell to a 10-point favorable margin, 54-44, but among women it swelled to a 17-point edge, 58-41.\n\nAn earlier FOX News poll released on March 14 showed a smaller Obama advantage over Romney, 46-42, but the pattern of support from men and women for the two candidates revealed similarly large gaps. Men backed Romney by 5 points, 48-43, while women were in Obama’s camp by a solid 12 points, 49-37.\n\nPerhaps equally troubling for Romney, the same survey reveals that the Republican Party is currently held in substantially lower esteem than the Democratic Party by both men and women.\n\nFavorable opinions of the Democratic Party outweighed negative views in the CNN polls by a modest 3 points, 48-45. There was, however, a huge gender gap. Men were unfavorable by 8 points, 50-42, while women were favorable by 14 points, 54-40.\n\nThe Republican Party was viewed unfavorably by a wide 23-point margin, 58-35 in the CNN poll. In this case, the negative views of men and women were similar, 57-36 among men, and 59-34 among women.\n\nThe Pew Research Center has broken down Romney and Obama’s support not only among men and women, but among different demographic groups of men and women:\n\nLooking at this data, some findings stand out:\n\nFor Romney, the most important voters are white and he is falling far short of the margins he must win among these voters in order to prevail on November 6. In the close 2004 presidential election, George W. Bush beat John Kerry 51-49. Bush won among white men by 25 points, 62-37, and among white women by 11 points, 55-44. Romney, by comparison, has only a 15 point edge among white men, 55-40, and is running even, 48-48, among white women.\n\nRomney’s weaknesses among women are concentrated among those with college educations, both white and minority – he loses them in the Pew poll by 62-36, including a 57-40 margin of defeat among college-educated white women. He loses 56-39 among all women without college degrees, both white and minority, but holds a 10-point lead among white women without degrees.\n\nThere is almost no gender gap between ideologically moderate men and moderate women of all races, but Obama’s advantages among both groups, 62-36 (men) and 62-32 (women) are daunting numbers for the Republican candidate.\n\nWhile the partisan leanings of women vary widely by race, education and marital status, within every demographic category, women are more Democratic (or less Republican), and more liberal (or less conservative) than their male counterparts. While generally Republican, white women, for example, are roughly 10 points less Republican than white men. The Pew survey shows a consistent pattern of women of all races holding, on average, more liberal stands than men on a wide range of issues.\n\nWomen, for example, support more government assistance to the poor, the elderly and children by consistently higher margins (9 to 11 points) than men, according to Pew. In addition, women back tougher regulation of food production and packing by 61 percent, compared to 45 percent of men. Women are more in favor of stronger workplace safety regulations by 13 points more than men.\n\nAsked whether peace is best achieved through military strength or good diplomacy, majorities of both sexes chose diplomacy, but the margin among men, 53-35, was 22 points in favor, compared to the 35-point, 62-27, among women.\n\nIn other words, Romney has his work cut out for him. As the primary process demonstrated, he is not noticeably adept at shifting ground from center to the right, although his ability to move from right back to the center has not been fully tested.\n\nFormer Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich, a Romney supporter, suggested that for the general election Romney will be a different man on women’s issues than the Romney of the primaries. “When you have a one-on-one general election, they will see Governor Romney’s real views, and that gender gap will disappear really quickly.”\n\nWhile Romney’s strategies are a work in progress, trends in the 2012 campaign point to a novel reality: In past elections, Democrats have suffered at the hands of Republican skill in the use of wedge issues — race, crime, welfare, abortion and gay rights — issues that divided Democratic constituencies, weakening the party in November.\n\nThis time, Democrats have their own wedge issues to further weaken Republican support among women (reproductive rights), Hispanics (immigration reform) and seniors (Medicare cuts, as recently approved in the Paul Ryan-sponsored House budget). As Steny Hoyer, the House Democratic Whip, puts it, “There is no balance in this proposal. Seniors, middle class, vulnerable, working Americans are asked to pay the price of this agreement. Not only are they asked to pay the price, but the best-off among us is asked to do the least.”\n\nRomney faces a huge but not insurmountable task. 24 years ago, George H. W. Bush was more than 15 points behind Michael S. Dukakis in the summer of 1988 and went on to beat the Massachusetts governor by seven points, 53-46.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nIt was just one line slipped into the middle of a paragraph of Mitt Romney’s speech on April 3 celebrating his primary victories in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia: “And the most vulnerable have been hurt the most — over 30 percent of single moms are struggling in poverty.” Seemingly un"}

The situation grew even more muddled when Mr. Giuliani disputed what his campaign had said about his condition, saying that in fact he had been suffering from a severe headache and that his doctor would be able to issue a definitive statement this week after seeing test results.\n\nAs a result of all this, what might have been a one-day campaign trail story was still reverberating on Sunday.\n\nMr. Giuliani’s decision to maintain a light schedule of public appearances compared with his rivals, particularly Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Senator John McCain of Arizona, has stirred concern among some prospective supporters who fear that he does not appear hungry for the job, a criticism that shadowed him when he ran for senator in New York in 2000.\n\n“I hate to say this, but I don’t think Rudy wants it badly enough,” Patrick Ruffini, a blogger, wrote on Townhall.com, a conservative Web site.\n\nThat sentiment by Mr. Ruffini, a former e-mail director for the Republican National Committee, was featured prominently on the editorial page of The Concord Monitor on Sunday, greeting Mr. Giuliani on a day when he had two campaign events in New Hampshire.\n\nMr. Giuliani is still viewed as a very strong candidate with continued high potential in a very unsettled field. He could be helped by the unusual calendar of nominating contests, with the chance it provides for him to pick up large numbers of delegates on Feb. 5 and recover from any early setbacks.\n\n“We have always run a campaign that is based on a long-term strategy of getting the most delegates,” said Mike DuHaime, his campaign manager.\n\nStill, the difficulties within Mr. Giuliani’s campaign come as he faces changes in the political landscape that do not appear to be to his benefit. For much of the year, he was helped by his positioning as tough on terrorism and by the perception among many Republicans that he was their best weapon to block Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton were she to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nBut issues like immigration are proving far more decisive among Republicans than terrorism, especially since the violence in Iraq has diminished. Mrs. Clinton is struggling to win her own party’s nomination, which has had the effect of undercutting what had been one of Mr. Giuliani’s biggest selling points.\n\nMr. Giuliani’s closest advisers in this campaign include a number of longtime loyalists who, though seasoned in New York City politics, have not run a national campaign before. One of the key questions from the start of his entry into the race has been the extent to which Mr. Giuliani would open up this circle — a small, rarely changing circle of hard-driving New Yorkers, known for tough language and tough tactics — to advisers with national experience.\n\nTo a certain extent, he has done this. Acting on the recommendation of Ken Mehlman, the former Republican National Committee chairman, Mr. Giuliani named Mr. DuHaime, a former political director of the Republican National Committee, as his campaign director, and Mr. DuHaime brought a number of veterans of the Republican committee with him.\n\nBut Republicans who have dealt with the campaign say that it is more Anthony Carbonetti, along with other New York insiders, who has Mr. Giuliani’s ear, and who is, with the former mayor, driving many of the major decisions in the campaign. Mr. Carbonetti, who has been a senior adviser to Mr. Giuliani since his early days in New York politics, has continued working at Mr. Giuliani’s consulting firm, Giuliani Partners, and spends much of his time not at Mr. Giuliani’s campaign headquarters in Lower Manhattan, but at the firm’s headquarters in Times Square.\n\nThe two camps were described by some campaign officials as culturally uneasy with one another. All the senior officials hold Thursday morning conference call strategy sessions, known as “the Chairman’s Call,” because it is led by the Giuliani campaign chairman, Patrick C. Oxford, a long-time fund-raiser.\n\nWhen campaign aides talk about strategy, especially in public settings, they have taken to calling Mr. Giuliani “Ralph” rather than “Rudy,” according to associates of Mr. Giuliani.\n\nOne participant in the calls, who asked not to be identified because he was discussing internal campaign strategy, said the advisers often spent hours talking about subjects like the logistics of campaign events — where Mr. Giuliani would stand, what the backdrop would be — rather than a long-term message that goes beyond the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks or Mr. Giuliani’s record as mayor of New York.\n\nMr. Giuliani and his team are making a tremendous gamble: that he can make only token efforts in Iowa, New Hampshire and, probably, South Carolina, but still go on to win in Florida in late January and in many of the big states holding primaries or caucuses on Feb. 5.\n\nHis campaign has settled on that strategy after veering back and forth about the right approach. At first, his advisers signaled that he would largely bypass Iowa, as well as New Hampshire, where Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, enjoys a home-field advantage. Then he made moves to compete in both those states, especially New Hampshire, where he invested heavily in advertising and went toe-to-toe with Mr. Romney, who has spent close to $8 million on television spots.\n\nBut now Mr. Giuliani’s advisers say they have decided that their route to victory is to do well in Michigan on Jan. 15 and to win in Florida on Jan. 29. That would give him strength heading into Feb. 5, when 22 states — including New York, New Jersey and California, all of which have large numbers of delegates and relatively moderate Republican voters — hold their contests.\n\n“At the end of the day, it’s a numbers game,” Mr. Carbonetti said.\n\nWhat this has meant is that while the rest of the candidates have been in Iowa, where their every move is followed by hundreds of reporters, Mr. Giuliani has been investing much of his time in fund-raising or paying visits to states which have later contests. His campaign has reached a point where his success is increasingly contingent on other candidates’ failing.\n\nIf either Mr. Romney or Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, wins two or three of the first contests, Mr. Giuliani’s task will be greatly complicated, particularly if party leaders and contributors begin coalescing around someone who appears to be a winner.\n\nIndeed, one of the points of division in Mr. Giuliani’s campaign is how to deal with the sudden threat of Mr. Huckabee. Some of them are arguing that a strong showing by Mr. Huckabee in Iowa would help Mr. Giuliani by muddying the field. Others are warning that Mr. Huckabee could eclipse Mr. Giuliani if they do not knock him back now.\n\nMr. Giuliani’s position has changed notably from even a month ago. For much of this year, Republicans had expressed admiration, and some surprise, at the extent to which he appeared to have dealt with concerns about his views on abortion and gay rights, as well as his private life. Mr. Giuliani showed significant leads in most national polls; he routinely drew warm and enthusiastic receptions from audiences more conservative than he.\n\nHis advisers say that a recent run of negative news reports, focusing on an extramarital affair and his association with Bernard Kerik, the disgraced former police commissioner that Mr. Giuliani recommended as homeland security secretary, is beginning to take a toll.\n\n“I am a little disappointed with his personal life,” said Elisabeth Ackerson, speaking about Mr. Giuliani after attending a Town Hall meeting for Mr. Romney on Saturday evening in Londonderry, N.H. She said was trying to decide among Mr. Romney, Mr. McCain and Mr. Giuliani.\n\nThe apparent failure of Mr. Giuliani’s advertising campaign in New Hampshire stirred particular concern among some Giuliani advisers.\n\nMr. Carbonetti said the campaign decided to pull back on the television advertising after determining that the sheer glut from other candidates in New Hampshire was making it impossible for Mr. Giuliani’s spots to break though. “The airwaves were saturated,” he said.\n\nEd Goeas, Mr. Giuliani’s pollster, said he thought any gain from the advertising had been offset by news reports about whether Mr. Giuliani’s city administration in New York had properly accounted for his security costs, including during time he was spending with Judith Nathan, then his girlfriend and now his wife.\n\nBut other Giuliani advisers said they feared that the failure of the advertising to strengthen him in New Hampshire was evidence that Mr. Giuliani’s attempt to run for president based largely on his record as mayor was flawed.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Giuliani Hits Rocky Stretch As Vote Nears.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00007-of-00064--993", "original_text": "When it comes to diving deep, Cuvier's beaked whales lead the pack. In a study published in March 2014, scientists tracked these typically elusive whales and reported one whale dove to the dizzying depths of 2,992 m (9,816ft). The same whale stayed underwater, without taking a single breath, for 138 minutes.\n\nThe feat was exceptional, breaking new mammalian dive records in two categories simultaneously. But while the Cuvier's beaked whales have proved themselves as the champion divers, other marine mammals have also evolved, and honed, the ability to dive deep and long. Sperm whales routinely dive between 500m and 1000m, Weddell seals go to 600m, and elephant seals can hold their breath for two hours.\n\n\"It's just astonishing what these animals can do,\" says Andreas Fahlman of Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi. \"These animals do these deep dives day in, day out, sometimes repeating the dives a number of times a day, and don't seem to have any problems with it. So the constant question we ask ourselves is: how do they do that?\"\n\nAnimals dive deep for one reason, and one reason alone: to get food, says Randall Davis, who is also at Texas A&M University. \"These whales are making these dives to tremendous depths because there's some payback in terms of a food resource,\" Davis says. \"Animals don't do these kinds of things for fun. This is how they make a living.\"\n\nBut it's a challenging way to make a living. The most immediate problem is the extreme, crushing pressure. At 1000m down, a Cuvier's beaked whale experiences 100 times the pressure that they do at the surface, enough to completely compress the air in their lungs.\n\nTo avoid this, Randall says, they have rib cages that can fold down, collapsing their lungs and reducing air pockets. Then, right before diving, these mammals exhale 90% of the air in their lungs. This also reduces their buoyancy, making it easier to dive.\n\nBut that introduces a new problem. With little oxygen in their lungs, the whales have to be thrifty when it comes to using the gas on their dives. \"They are very frugal,\" Fahlman says. \"They're just really, really tightly holding onto this oxygen and trying to use it as conservatively as possible.\"\n\nTo stop using so much oxygen, diving mammals can stop their breathing and shunt blood flow from their extremities to the brain, heart, and muscles. They also shut down digestion, kidney and liver function.\n\nFinally, they lower their heart rate. Most mammals can do this when they dive, even humans. But in marine mammals the slowdown can be extreme. Scientists have measured the heart rate of diving Weddell seals at a mere four beats per minute.\n\nThe animals also adapt their behaviour to conserve oxygen by reducing how much they move. In 2000, Terrie Williams of the University of California, Santa Cruz and colleagues attached miniature cameras to Weddell seals, a bottlenose dolphin, an elephant seal and a blue whale. They found that the animals simply glided downwards without moving a muscle. Their shrunken lungs reduced their buoyancy, allowing them to sink rather than swim.\n\nBut it's not enough to just be stingy with oxygen. Once they're in deep water, divers like Cuvier's beaked whales have to sneak up on, and overcome, their prey. For that, they need to find some oxygen.\n\nFortunately, they have a supply: they store oxygen in their blood and muscles. Marine mammals have a higher percentage of oxygen-storing red blood cells than most mammals, making their blood thick and viscous. They also have a high blood-to-body-volume ratio. \"They simply have a bigger savings account than we do,\" Fahlman says.\n\nBut this shouldn't be enough. \"From what people have estimated for the oxygen stored, and the rate at which they are consuming this oxygen, it shouldn't be possible for animals to dive to these depths at all,\" says Michael Berenbrink of the University of Liverpool in the UK.\n\nThen in 2013, Berenbrink made a startling discovery about diving animals' muscles. Like all mammals, their muscles contain a protein called myoglobin that stores oxygen and gives meat its red colour. Myoglobin is ten times more concentrated in the muscles of diving animals than it is in human muscles. It is so concentrated in whales that their flesh appears almost black.\n\nBut there should be a limit to the amount of myoglobin that muscles can contain. If too many of the molecules pack into a small space, they could stick together. Such clumping can cause serious diseases in humans, such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. Yet Berenbrink found that diving animals' muscles seemingly carry too much myoglobin.\n\nWhat's their secret? Berenbrink found that the myoglobin of diving animals is positively charged. Since like charges repel each other, the positively-charged myoglobin molecules don't stick together. This means that huge amounts of myoglobin can be packed in, supplying plenty of oxygen.\n\nBerenbrink found that all the diving mammals he studied had positively-charged myoglobin, although some had larger positive charges than others. The highest concentrations of myoglobin occur in the muscles needed for swimming, exactly where the divers need it the most. What's more, genetic analyses suggested that beaked whales should have the highest levels of myoglobin, as we would expect.\n\nBut while Berenbrink's work has found a veritable built-in oxygen tank in divers, he says we still don't know whether this tank provides enough for the long dives made by beaked whales. \"There is still a lot that we don't know,\" Berenbrink says.\n\nEven if the diving mammals do have enough oxygen, they're still not out of the woods. They must also deal with a disorder called decompression sickness, or \"the bends\". In humans, the bends can be fatal. And it turns out marine mammals are also at risk.\n\nWhen a human scuba diver is at depth, gases dissolve in their blood. If the diver then comes up too quickly, the pressure drop causes gas bubbles to emerge from the bloodstream and get lodged in capillaries and critical organs. This causes discomfort and pain, and sometimes death.\n\nLate in 2002, 14 beaked whales washed ashore together on a beach in the Canary Islands. When scientists performed an autopsy on 10 of the whales, they found deadly tissue damage that is usually associated with pockets of gas in vital organs. That suggested the whales had the bends.\n\nScientists had thought diving mammals were immune from the condition, even though they had found such bubbles before in stranded animals. Between 1992 and 2003, researchers found bubble-associated tissue injury in dolphins, porpoises and a single Blainville's beaked whale washed up on British shores.\n\nThe question was finally settled in 2013, when Daniel García-Párraga of Oceanografic in Valencia, Spain and his colleagues diagnosed the bends for the first time in live marine animals: loggerhead sea turtles.\n\nThe turtles had been accidentally caught in commercial fishing nets and bought in by local fishermen. Of the 21 that arrived alive, 9 showed signs of spasticity. CT scans revealed bubbles in the turtles' organs.\n\nIt's easy to diagnose decompression sickness: simply put the animal under higher pressure and see if the symptoms clear. To that end, García placed the two smallest turtles in the lab autoclave and recompressed them using similar protocols to those used for human divers. The turtles made a full recovery and García eventually released them back into the wild.\n\n\"That is the first time anybody anywhere in the world has achieved a clinical diagnosis of decompression sickness in a live marine vertebrate,\" says Michael Moore of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts.\n\nThe finding is important for efforts to conserve sea turtles. We now know that turtles caught up in fishing nets may suffer from the bends, and need treatment before being let go. If fishermen simply untangle them from the nets and release them immediately, the turtles may die of decompression sickness.\n\nOutside of fishing, though, it is hard to see why marine mammals would ever get the bends. A 2011 study by Fahlman and his colleagues indicated that they are always susceptible to the condition, yet in normal conditions are able to avoid getting it. Decompression sickness happens if they ascend too quickly, so surely they should have evolved not to do that. But maybe something is forcing them to rush to the surface?\n\nIn the 2002 beaching, a series of military exercises involving sonar took place in the region just four hours earlier. Since that incident, researchers have noted the links between sonar activity and strandings of marine mammals on beaches in the Mediterranean Sea, the Canary Islands, and the Bahamas.\n\nIn theory, if whales are 1000m or 2000m down, the noise of sonar could send them rocketing up to the surface. If they came up too quickly, their anti-decompression mechanisms might not keep up. But we can't confirm this, Fahlman says. \"No one even understands how they avoid the bends, let alone how they then go on to get the bends in certain situations,\" Fahlman says.\n\nWhales do seem to dislike sonar. When scientists exposed Cuvier's beaked whales to simulations of sonar for a 2013 study, the whales stopped fluking and echolocating, and swam away rapidly and silently. They then stayed underwater longer than normal.\n\n\"But really what does that show?\" asks Fahlman. \"It doesn't tell us anything about how the whales might behave underwater, at great depths.\"\n\nFahlman says the only way to understand why the whales get the bends is to figure out their normal behaviour and physiology, in particular how they cope when deep diving. But that is no mean task, not least because whales are far too big to ever study in a laboratory.\n\nThese studies could have unexpected benefits, adds Fahlman. By unravelling the physiology of extreme diving, researchers may figure out how to treat certain clinical conditions in humans. One example is atelectasis, in which a person's lungs collapse, obstructing breathing. Marine mammals' extreme dives may point the way to a cure.\n\n\"They're diving to depths that are absolutely phenomenal,\" Fahlman says. \"With our current knowledge of physiology, they're going way over and beyond what they're supposed to be able to do.\"", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nWhen it comes to diving deep, Cuvier's beaked whales lead the pack.

The AP buries the lead in a shallow grave, the second paragraph:\n\nHuh? Didn't Kloppenburg declare victory Wednesday, sitting atop a lead of more than 200 votes (out of some 1.5 million)? Didn't MoveOn.org's Steve Hughes confirm this in an email yesterday? Yes, he did:\n\nWe'll bet Hughes has taking a HUGE breath now. Literally!!\n\nSo has, or is, Mark Miller, minority leader of the Wisconsin Senate, who yesterday sent out an email, forwarded to us by reader Tom Werlein, peddling T-shirts in honor of--we're not making this up--the \"14 brave Senators from Wisconsin [who] left the state\" in a \"heroic effort\" (albeit an unsuccessful one) to thwart Gov. Scott Walker's plan to reform state government by precluding a legislative quorum.\n\n\"Two nights ago,\" Miller crows, \"Walker's good friend Supreme Court Justice David Prosser was defeated in his re-election effort--despite leading in initial polls by over 30%! Clearly the people of Wisconsin are standing up and rejecting Scott Walker's agenda.\"\n\nClearly! Well, that is, if by \"the people of Wisconsin\" you mean all of them except the 40,000 or so who live in the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield. As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports, the Waukesha County clerk announced yesterday that she had erroneously omitted the Brookfield results from the unofficial returns she reported to the media Tuesday night. She caught the error during canvassing, a routine double-checking of vote totals. \"The new totals give 10,859 more votes to Prosser and 3,456 more to Kloppenburg,\" the paper reports.\n\nThere were also some minor adjustments in other counties, but the bottom line is that Prosser now leads by some 7,500 votes, or roughly 0.5%. Our headline exaggerates slightly, but assuming there isn't a comparable gain for Kloppenburg in Milwaukee, where canvassing is still under way, such a margin should be easily recount-proof.\n\n\"Scott Walker Struggles to Downplay Wisconsin Election That His Allies Built Up as a Referendum\" reads the headline of a Puffington Host post yesterday. But today's Puffington Host Daily Brief, an email newsletter, carries the neutral headline \"New Twists in Wisconsin Supreme Court Election\" on a story by the same blogress (though the headline on the site reveals that it's about Prosser taking the lead).\n\nIn truth, it was Wisconsin's government employee unions, whose privileges are endangered by Gov. Walker's reforms, that built the election up as a referendum, aided by their allies in the Democratic Party, the media and the liberal left. Assuming that Prosser has indeed won, this is a crushing defeat for them.\n\nThere were two reasons to think they might succeed in defeating Prosser. First, they were organized and motivated, providing a big advantage in what is typically a low-turnout election. (In the Feb. 15 jungle primary, in which Prosser bested Kloppenburg by 55% to 25%, only 420,000 people voted. That was approximately 48 hours before the debate over the Walker reforms reached the boiling point.)\n\nSecond, public opinion had supposedly shifted decisively against Walker and the GOP as the result of what even some conservatives feared was an ObamaCare-style overreach. \"The recent fight has cost Republicans support, strengthened unions, polarized the issue, and swung critical independents, who were essential to the Republicans' 2010 electoral victory, toward sympathizing with the unions,\" wrote Heather Higgins of the Independent Women's Forum two weeks ago, reporting on an IWF-commissioned Wisconsin poll. \"As it stands now, Republicans could not only lose, but lose badly,\" she warned, referring not only to the Prosser-Kloppenburg tilt but also recall efforts against GOP senators that aim to flip control of the chamber.\n\nIt must be acknowledged that the pro-union left succeeded in making this campaign into a referendum on Walker. Had it not, it's likely that turnout would have been much lower and Prosser's margin of victory much wider, as in the primary. But they lost the referendum. With Prosser proffered as a proxy for Walker (we dare you to say that 10 times fast), the justice's approximately 50.5% of the vote is a swing of less than 2% away from Walker, elected last November with 52.3%.\n\n\"What does this change in Wisconsin?\" asks Slate's Dave Weigel, who answers:\n\nWeigel certainly gives new meaning to the word \"informed.\" But whereas we thought Kloppenburg had a real chance of beating Prosser, we've always been skeptical to the point of incredulity about the prospects for recalling Republican senators. That's because under Wisconsin law, an official has to have served for a year before being subject to recall. That shields both Walker and all Republican lawmakers who replaced Democrats in last year's election. As Wisconsin senators serve four-year terms, only those who survived the Democratic sweep of 2006 or 2008 can be recalled.\n\nIt only gets worse for Wisconsin Democrats. Kloppenburg's campaign implied--though in her \"victory\" press conference she robotically denied--that she would provide the deciding vote on the court to overturn Walker's reforms. Her defeat means that those reforms will soon take effect unless they have an actual legal defect.\n\nOne of the most important reforms is that union dues will become voluntary. State and local government will no longer take money out of their employees' paychecks and hand it over to the unions. This is likely to be the last Wisconsin election in which the Democrats have the advantage of support from organizations with the power to raise campaign funds coercively.\n\nThe unions' show of muscle in this week's election was not unimpressive, even though it was insufficient to the task at hand. Starved of the nourishment of forcibly collected dues, they may look like a 98-pound weakling by 2012.\n\nFor That Matter, When Will Big Kloppenburg? \"David Prosser: When Will Big Tobacco Give Up?\"--headline, Independent (London), April 8\n\nWarm Salami \"New Warning on Arctic Sea Ice Melt\" reads a headline on the BBC website. Ho hum, another global-warming alarm, right? But it turns out it's even less alarming than you think. The \"new warning\" is the same as the old warning, only less urgent:\n\nWell, our best guess is that in 2015 they'll have a new best guess of 2020; in 2019 it'll be 2024, etc. This is what's known, in another discipline, as \"salami economics,\" in which economists make repeated minor revisions to their estimates and hope you won't notice that when added up they are a major revision.\n\nOr let's try this another way. Our best guess is that Wieslaw Maslowski will die before the end of the year. If he's still alive in December, we'll modify that and guess he'll die in 2012. We can keep changing our guess every year. The difference between our guesses and his is that one of ours is bound to be right sooner or later.\n\nCan 'Diversity' Save Obama? National Journal's Ronald Brownstein reports that a new Pew Research Center poll \"underscores how slender a beachhead President Obama has established among whites more than two years into his presidency\":\n\nAside from schooled women, \"the rest of the white electorate remains deeply cool to Obama.\" (We were deeply cool to Obama before being deeply cool to Obama was cool.) \"Almost as troubling for Obama is his showing among Hispanics in the poll,\" Brownstein notes:\n\nWe noted the Gallup poll yesterday, which also found a drop-off in black support, to 85% from over 90%, although that may be an outlier.\n\nDespite the poor Hispanic showing, Brownstein predicts that \"Obama will benefit from a wave of diversity that has increased the minority share of the population in every state since 2000, according to recently released results from the 2010 Census.\" To elaborate this claim, Brownstein links to a week-old article of his:\n\nDo you see the problem with this logic? Obama was elected not in 2000 but in 2008, when most of the prospective \"new voters\" were already available. The census is a leading indicator for the allocation of electoral votes and congressional seats, but a lagging indicator of voter demographics. It's surprising that a pro like Brownstein would miss such an elementary point.\n\nCurses, Swiftboated Again! \"Hawk Attacks Man, Flies Away With Hat\"--headline, WFTV website (Orlando, Fla.), April 6\n\nThis Was the Moment When the Rise of the Oceans Began to Slow and Our Planet Began to Heal \"Grand Canyon Could Close Due to Federal Shutdown\"--headline, Associated Press, April 7\n\nThe Rat Takes the Cheese \"Harry Reid Stands Alone\"--headline, Politico.com, April 7\n\nIt's the Eponymy, Stupid \"Rep.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00012-of-00064--595", "original_text": "Senator Wendy Davis listens as the Texas Senate debate an abortion bill before the final vote, on July 12, 2013, in Austin.\n\nWendy Davis was always facing an uphill fight in her bid for the governorship of Texas, that reddest of red states. Nonetheless her entry into the race was hailed by the state’s Democrats as game-changer, a tide turner. She had become national star thanks to a 11 hour abortion rights filibuster in the Texas senate. And the party hoped she could tap into Texas’ longstanding fondness for strong outspoken and, yes, attractive women. The key to her gubernatorial campaign was to engage suburban women voters much as Ann Richards, the last and legendary Democratic governor did –hence the shorthand bio that told the tale of a bright, hardworking mom who climbed out of the dust of a Fort Worth trailer park to earn a spot at Harvard Law and launch a career.\n\nWith that inspiring Texas-style feminist fairy tale, Davis hoped she would be thought of as sprung from the same psychic soil as Richards who famously once said: “After all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels.”\n\nBut in January, that way too easy version of Davis’ early life fell afoul of fact-checkers who found discrepancies in the dates of her divorce and called into question what kind of mother she was while in law school. After two weeks of media skewering Davis’ story, which Davis blamed on her likely opponent, Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott — a claim rejected by him — Abbott is saying it’s time to move on. But the damage may have been done.\n\nPost “trailergate,” even friendly forces are losing faith in Davis’ ability to manage her communications team and to woo the suburban women who should be drawn to her bootstrapping biography. The Texas Observer, a longtime progressive stalwart publication, has chided the campaign for mismanagement of its media operation, and said it was hurting her candidacy.\n\nFrom right: Ma and Pa Ferguson.\n\nCampaign operational changes are expected, but getting women to see her as the next in that long line of tough Texas female politicians, may be harder now. Texans have had no qualms about voting sassy, strong, but usually centrist, women. Whether Davis, whose sudden national debut included a Vogue profile that revealed she loves Louboutins and Miu Miu heels and whose filibuster wardrobe included an Escada coat, is cut from the same cloth is the question. The first woman elected to high office was Miriam A. “Ma” Ferguson who, in 1925, succeeded her husband who had been impeached. The genteel, educated Miriam cast aside her chic hats and became “Ma” who posed with the chickens wearing a borrowed sunbonnet. Her slogan: “Me for Ma, and I ain’t got a durned thing against Pa” summed up the two-for-one approach that won Ferguson two terms.\n\nBut it was in the last three decades of the 20th century that women stood tall on the Texas stage. They include: Republicans Kay Bailey Hutchison and Susan Combs; Democrat turned Republican turned independent Carole Keeton Rylander Strayhorn; Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Jordan who left the statehouse as the first African-American state senator since 1883 and went to Washington to make her mark; and the legendary Ann Richards, a Democratic darling and the inspiration for a Davis’ bid.\n\nFormer Gov. Ann Richards in New York City, on Sept. 10, 1994.\n\nWhen Davis was given Richards’ shotgun at an Austin fundraiser earlier this month– the event was closed to many in the press, feeding what has become media dissatisfaction with her campaign — she posed with it and declared the Republicans were “messin’ with the wrong gal” and promised “to kick some ass.” The twang may have been inspired by Richards’ famous Waco accent, but it didn’t pack the same acerbic punch Richards’ one-liners commanded. An example: “I get a lot of cracks about my hair, mostly from men who don’t have any.”\n\n“She should have seen this attack coming,” says Cal Jillson, political scientist at Southern Methodist University, “everyone else did, so the fact that she and her team have handled it so badly is troublesome. She has tried, saying recently that Abbott ‘has messed with the wrong Texas gal,” but it lacks the snarl that Ann Richards or Carol Rylander would have brought to it.”\n\n“One tough grandma” is the way Carole Keeton Rylander Strayhorn labeled herself during her long career in Texas politics — it helped with her image as a tough centrist, and also helped voters struggling to remember her changing surname. Born Carole Keeton, she married a McClellan (mother to four McClellan boys, including Scott, sometime spokesman for President George W. Bush), then a Rylander and then a Strayhorn. Her politics shifted along the way also from Democrat to Republican, as she climbed from Austin mayor to insurance commissioner, to railroad commissioner to comptroller. When she took on a bid for governor in 2006 in a six way race for governor against incumbent Republican Gov. Rick Perry, she ran as a centrist independent.\n\nStrayhorn’s journey mirrored the path for many Texas Democrats. Richards’ win in 1990 marked the last major victory for the party. Once an umbrella party that dominated the state since Reconstruction, Democrats ran the gamut from liberal to so-called yellow dog conservatives.\n\nRichards hailed from the liberal wing, but in her demeanor, and on some issues, she was decidedly tough and Texan. She celebrated her 61st birthday during her unsuccessful bid for a second term with a dove-hunting trip. Guns inevitably play a role in Texas politics and despite Richards’ easy familiarity with a shotgun, her veto of a concealed weapons bill is considered to have cost her votes in her second bid for governor. Davis joined Abbott in supporting an open carry law for licensed gun owners, raising some eyebrows among the Democratic Party faithful, and then suggested cities and businesses could opt out of the law. She also told the Dallas Morning News she would have supported a 20 week ban on abortion if the law had allowed more input from women and their doctors.\n\n“Richards was successful as a moderate-to-liberal Democrat in an era when more Texas voters identified with the Democratic Party than with the Republican Party,” Mark P. Jones, Rice University political scientist says. “Conversely, Davis is making her run at the governorship as a moderate-to-liberal Democrat in an era when more Texas voters identify with the Republican Party.” In 1990, 40% of the voters self-identified as Democrats and 36% as Republicans. Twenty years later in 2010, Jones notes, 39% of the voters self-identified as Republicans and 28% as Democrats.\n\n“Women who have succeeded in politics have ranged from the calm, even sedate, problem solvers (Kay Bailey Hutchison and Susan Combs) to the more boisterous and gruff (Ann Richards and Carol Rylander),” Jillson says. “What you do not find in Texas, except in some fairly yeasty pockets, are feminist movement politicians.”\n\nThat may be part of the problem for Davis. “Wendy Davis’s strategic dilemma is that she came to broad public attention as a feminist movement politician with her famous filibuster against more stringent restrictions on abortion, but she knows she has to run her campaign on issues like education, roads, and water – mundane stuff that does not scare moderate suburban women away from her candidacy,” Jillson says. “The very effective, but entirely predictable, attack on her life story has stopped her transition from feminist fighter, (so-called) ‘abortion Barbie’ …to moderate, pragmatist and problem solver in its tracks.”\n\nWomen have made it to the top in Texas by stressing their problem-solving, practical skills. Richards was a county commissioner, then state treasurer before running for governor. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a University of Texas cheerleader, television news reporter, became a member of the Texas House of Representatives in 1972, where she served for four years, then went on to serve in the federal government, build a business and stay active in party politics, later winning a bid for state treasurer in 1990. She won big in a 1993 special election for the U.S. Senate and throughout her 20-year senate career Hutchison continued to win by overwhelming margins, always over 60 percent.\n\nAt one point Hutchison received over four million votes, more than any top of the ballot candidate except President George W. Bush. It was only when she decided to return to Texas and challenge Gov. Perry that her pragmatic approach and somewhat ambiguous views on abortion led her to run afoul of the rising Tea Party.\n\n“One common characteristic that Kay Bailey Hutchison, Susan Combs and Carole Keeton Strayhorn share is all three were considered to be pragmatic centrists,” says Jones. Combs, a six foot tall lawyer with a degree from Vassar, has a resume that includes Wall Street, Madison Avenue, the Dallas prosecutor’s office, a stint in the statehouse, and authorship of a steamy romance novel starring a tall, brainy brunette. She also is a fourth generation Big Bend rancher who took command of the family’s cattle operations when her brother chose a different career path.\n\nCombs took the GOP to task last fall, telling the Washington Times women voters care about three basic things — their families, their jobs and their futures. “Tell me that you give a flip about women’s interests,” she told the paper’s editorial board. “If all you want to talk about is my biology, ‘Gee what happened to my brain?’ That is my point. It is not all south of the waistline.” Combs decided to forego a bid for the lieutenant governorship this year in a Republican primary dominated by four conservatives that has been described by one Texas political wag as a race to the 19th century.\n\nDemocrats are hoping that the swing to the hard right will be a turnoff for Texas women. “The 1990 Richards campaign for governor was about suburban women,” Richards top aide Mary Beth Rogers wrote in the Texas Observer last fall. “We developed relevant targeted messages and voter contact activities aimed at moderate suburban women. It paid off on election day.” Citing a June 2013, Texas Tribune/University of Texas poll, Rogers noted only 38 percent of suburban women identified themselves as Republican, compared to 50 percent in 2010. On the other side, self-identified Democratic women increased from 37 percent to 46 percent. However, four months later, the same polling group found while Democratic share of suburban women remained at 46 percent, there had been a surge in Republican Party identification among suburban women to 45 percent, likely due to national issues such as Obamacare — statewide, the poll found more women, 68 percent, than men, 62 percent, opposed to the individual mandate.\n\nAs for abortion, the poll found 40 percent of Anglo women supported no restrictions, 41 percent of African-American women in Texas shared that position, but the number slipped to 32 percent for Hispanics. In a June, 2013 Tribune poll, 62 percent of Texans opposed abortions after 20 weeks — the issue at the heart of the Davis filibuster. Unlike the women who have gone before her — Richards, Hutchison, Strayhorn and Combs — Davis is not a familiar face to many Texans, and she does not arrive armed with kitchen table issues. There is no doubt she tackled those issues as a city councilwoman and later state senator in Fort Worth, but it was not her filibuster of cuts in public education in 2011 that launched her statewide bid, but her nationally-covered 2013 abortion rights stance.\n\nA lot has changed in Texas since the early 1990s when Davis struggled to balance family and career, and Richards was winning her place in Texas political history. “The ‘D’ next to Richards’ name in 1990 represented an electoral advantage that mitigated the impact attacks on her for being ‘too liberal,’ ” Jones says. That ‘D’ label is now a disadvantage, one Davis must overcome without the distractions of campaign missteps and fuzzy bios. It is a tall task. “I suspect were Ann Richards running for governor today she very well might face even longer odds than Davis in a bid to defeat Greg Abbott,” Jones added.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00003-of-00064--1084", "original_text": "Washington (CNN) -- When Leticia Van de Putte walked into the storied Willard Hotel one block from the White House last month, she didn't invoke the stares of gaping tourists or eager handshakes from power-seeking staffers.\n\nInstead, she rolled her own suitcase wearing Texas Longhorn cowboy boots -- an accessory she was happy she brought from Texas on that snowy March day in the nation's capital.\n\nVan de Putte gave no hints that she was running for lieutenant governor, the second-highest office in Texas -- and some would argue the most powerful. She was deferential to hotel staff and eagerly arranged oversized chairs to set up for the interview -- rare in a town where elected officials have staff at their beck and call, even to dial numbers on their mobile phones.\n\nHer profile is on the rise\n\nThe San Antonio state senator could accomplish what no Democrat has done in 20 years: win statewide office.\n\nThe pharmacist has been a power broker during her nearly 25 years in the state legislature. In 2003, she led the dramatic 45-day walkout that Senate Democrats staged over the Republican redistricting plan. The lawmakers bolted to New Mexico, delaying a vote on the plan, although Republicans were eventually able to pass it.\n\nVan de Putte doesn't elicit the same star power or national intrigue as Wendy Davis, her state Senate colleague at the top of the ticket. Davis grabbed national headlines last June when she staged an 11-hour filibuster in the Texas Senate that blocked restrictive abortion legislation from being passed.\n\nDemocrats seize on equal pay as a midterm issue\n\nThat day was a big moment for Davis, propelling her into the national spotlight and into the gubernatorial race. It also re-established some relevance for Texas Democrats in a state dominated by Republicans.\n\nFor Van de Putte it was a defining day. As Davis' filibuster charged on into the night, Van de Putte missed most of it because she was at the funeral of her father, who had been killed in a car accident. After a mournful day, she decided to join her colleagues at the State House.\n\n\"I remember her walking onto the Senate floor. I could see it in her face. She was just drained,\" said Grace Garcia, a friend and political ally who was in the spectator gallery. \"She did it because she wanted to support the women in Texas.\"\n\nThe emotionally exhausted Van de Putte attempted to speak on the Senate floor but the Republican majority had turned off her microphone.\n\nFinally she raised her voice to be heard, asking, \"Did the President hear me or did the President hear me and refuse to recognize me?\"\n\n\"At what point must a female senator raise her hand or her voice to be recognized over her male colleagues?\" she continued.\n\nThe gallery, filled with women's rights advocates, erupted in prolonged cheers and applause, igniting a new wave of energy into the fierce debate over abortion restrictions.\n\n\"Something was unleashed at that moment. It just exploded. People started clapping and it didn't stop,\" Garcia said.\n\nVan de Putte was energized from the cheers of support that June night. But her political profile received an even greater boost as political operatives in the state increasingly looked to her for higher office.\n\nBut the lieutenant governor's job was not at the forefront of her mind. Her father's sudden death was the latest in a series of family tragedies. Just a month earlier her 5-month old grandson died in his sleep. And her mother-in-law also died the same year.\n\n\"When you lose so much, you realize what your priorities are,\" she said.\n\nSo when Garcia, her longtime friend who also runs Annie's List, an organization that works to elect women to office in Texas, met Van de Putte to ask her to run for lieutenant governor, Van de Putte refused to commit.\n\nDuring their two-hour lunch at El Mirador restaurant in downtown San Antonio last August, Van de Putte told Garcia she was worried about her family.\n\n\"My family had a really, really tough, tough year,\" Van de Putte told CNN as tears welled up in her eyes. \"I was honestly trying to keep my family together ... to heal.\"\n\nVan de Putte, a mother of six and grandmother of six, said she didn't know if her family \"was strong enough\" to withstand personal political attacks on her during such a fragile time.\n\nBut three months after her lunch with Garcia, Van de Putte announced that she was going to jump into the race against a cadre of Republican candidates who Van de Putte adamantly disagreed with. During the campaign, her Republican opponents have touted the expansion of school vouchers, teaching creationism in schools and demonizing illegal immigrants.\n\n\"The topics they are talking about are certainly not what Texas voters are talking about,\" Van de Putte said.\n\nHer Republican opponent could be one of two people who are currently engaged in a runoff for the Republican nomination. One is current Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. The other is state Sen. Dan Patrick.\n\nWhile Dewhurst has the support of establishment Republicans, as he did in his unsuccessful primary against now-Sen. Ted Cruz in 2010, he is shifting his policies further to the right, trying to overtake Patrick, the front-runner. Patrick is running to the far right, making immigration and his self-described \"illegal invasion\" a central tenet of his campaign.\n\n\"As a Latino, we're over it,\" Ramiro Cavazos, president and CEO of the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce, said of the Republican candidates' platforms. \"I think it's a very backward approach.\"\n\nVan de Putte called Patrick's campaign \"entertaining\" and decried the use of immigration as a wedge issue to divide the Republican base and suppress Democratic, especially Latino, turnout.\n\nShe promises to run a business-friendly campaign focused on education, water and transportation.\n\nBut Latino turnout in Texas is already suppressed. A term heard over and over again when talking about Texas politics is that the state is not a Republican one or a Democratic one but a nonvoting one. The problem for Democrats is would-be Democratic voters stay home on Election Day at a far higher rate than Republicans.\n\nMany of the people who don't vote are Latino, a key demographic for the Democratic Party. In the last election, President Barack Obama received 70% of the Latino vote nationally. But in Texas, where more than one-third of people are Hispanic, 61% of those eligible did not vote. Contrast that with the statistic that shows that 61% of eligible whites did, according to the group Latino Decisions.\n\n\"The reason Texas doesn't elect Democrats is because the biggest portion of the base of the Democratic Party doesn't vote,\" Gilberto Hinojosa, chair of the Texas Democratic Party, said.\n\nIncreasing voter turnout, however, is facing a major uphill battle as new voter ID laws have made it more difficult to vote. Van de Putte said she had to vote with an affidavit because her name didn't match the voter database.\n\nBut Texas Democrats believe Van de Putte is the answer.\n\n\"Leticia's candidacy can help energize the part of the base that has not been participating in elections,\" Hinojosa said.\n\nThat's because Van de Putte is the perfect demographic: a Hispanic woman.\n\nShe entered Texas politics when few women and even fewer Latinos were elected to office. She has deep roots in the state. She is a sixth-generation Texan, or Tejano, whose grandmothers are from Mexico.\n\n\"Her family is a part of the cultural landscape of San Antonio,\" Democratic National Committee finance chair Henry Munoz said. Her mother was a leader of a culturally important and community-centered mariachi groups in the country, he said.\n\n\"This is an important moment in the history of Texas,\" Munoz added. \"The demographics of the state are changing. We need leaders who look like us and understand who we are.\"\n\nSupporters believe that Van de Putte will also appeal to women in Texas -- Latino and others.\n\nRepublicans hit a nerve when it comes to Obamacare\n\nGarcia, with Annie's List, said that the Democratic ticket featuring two women at the top -- Davis and Van de Putte - is a stark contrast to the all-male Republican ticket for the other statewide races this election year.\n\nGarcia said women in the Democratic Party are re-energized since Davis' filibuster, momentum that could carry into Election Day in November, she said.\n\n\"There's a great opportunity for both Leticia and Wendy to have a very important conversation with women in Texas,\" Garcia said.\n\nBut Van de Putte has challenges to overcome.\n\nWhile she is immensely popular in San Antonio as its state senator and a pharmacist in the city's culturally rich Hispanic and Tejano west side, she is largely unknown outside of the city.\n\nShe has a lot of work to do to raise her profile and introduce herself to voters in the vast expanse of the second largest state in the country that consists of more than 254 counties and 20 media markets.\n\nVan de Putte is her married name -- a Belgium surname that doesn't completely describe her background. Although she said she has no regrets in taking her husband's Belgian last name more than 30 years ago, a name is the first way to impression voters, especially the low propensity or \"virgin\" voter.\n\nShe insists that Latinos will know that she is Latina. \"Van de Putte is not a Latino name, but Leticia is,\" she said.\n\nIf that fails, she invokes her maiden name: \"I'm Leticia San Miguel Van de Putte,\" she said.\n\nWhy is this man running for governor of California?\n\nBut Van de Putte is acutely aware of the uphill battle she faces.\n\n\"First thing we need to do is raise the resources so I can get that message out,\" Van de Putte said.\n\nIntroducing Leticia Van de Putte to Texas voters is an expensive venture. And while Wendy Davis, the woman at the top of the Texas ticket, has done a good job raising funds, raising more than $12 million as of the last fundraising report in January, Van de Putte's fundraising has been less impressive, raising about $290,000 the first two months of her campaign.\n\n\"I think she's going to be able to raise -- not what the Republicans can raise -- but will be able to raise enough to compete,\" Hinojosa said.\n\nVan de Putte just completed a multiweek bus tour across Texas that included multiple fundraisers per week. And in Washington to participate in a women's empowerment event hosted by Politico, she used the trip to raise national dollars. She met the staff of numerous political action committees, including the Human Rights Campaign's PAC.\n\nBut Cal Jillison, political science professor at Southern Methodist University, injected a dose of reality into the equation.\n\n\"I suspect that the Democratic ticket will rise or fall -- most likely fall -- with Davis,\" he said. \"Van de Putte could help Davis with Hispanics, but is unlikely to win if Davis loses.\"\n\nHer supporters say her ability to build coalitions and appeal to many different types proves that she's one of the best chances Texas Democrats have.\n\nDemocrats unveil agenda aimed at keeping Senate\n\nWhen she speaks, her easy transition from humor to wonkish policy is speckled with hints of a Texas drawl and bursts of Spanish idioms.\n\nMunoz, her long-time friend and DNC finance chair, said she is known for walking into a crowd and saying, \"Buenos Noches, ya'll.\"\n\nHinojosa tells a similar story. He said she can walk into a room of skeptical West Texas farmers and connect with them.\n\nHer appeal to both Hispanics and women, combined with the Democratic Party's and allied groups' invigorated efforts at registering and persuading people to vote, could be the key ingredients for a successful campaign.\n\n\"If we don't elect her, shame on us. If we don't vote, shame on us,\" Munoz said.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nWashington (CNN) -- When Leticia Van de Putte walked into the storied Willard Hotel one block from the White House last month, she didn't invoke the stares of gaping tourists or eager handshakes from power-seeking staffers.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00001-of-00064--406", "original_text": "Less than a year ago, the Indianapolis radio station WRWM, then known as Indy’s i94, was the 15th-most-popular station in the Central Indiana market. It played a forgettable mix of Maroon 5, Sam Smith and other staples of what in radio lingo is called hot adult contemporary — the sort of stuff that drivers might alight on for a song or two but rarely add to their presets. For the last six months of 2014, among listeners ages 6 and older, the station’s Nielsen ratings hovered around a 2.0 share, meaning roughly 2 percent of radio listeners in the market tuned in.\n\nI94’s corporate parent, Cumulus Media — a conglomerate that owns about 460 radio stations in 90 U.S. markets — thought it could do better. Last fall, Davey Morris, a Cumulus program director at one of the company’s branch offices in Providence, R.I., called Jay Michaels, the station program director at i94, to discuss a number of ideas for revamping the floundering station, up to and including a format change. Changing formats is something radio stations avoid as best they can: It’s expensive and, for corporate-owned stations, usually involves extensive market research. If i94 changed, it would be the station’s 10th switch in 21 years.\n\nThe 93.9 slot in Indianapolis hadn’t enjoyed any real success since it first went live in 1993. That year, it began as Ecstasy (WXTZ), an independently owned easy-listening station. It switched to a solid-gold soul format in 1996, then to smooth jazz the next year. It switched again in 1997, to country, and that year it was acquired by a conglomerate called Susquehanna Radio. Susquehanna moved its country station (104.5 the Bear, WGRL) down the dial to occupy the 93.9 frequency, before switching it to ’80s hits in 2001, and from that to contemporary Christian in 2004.\n\nThe station became syndicated talk radio in 2006, and later that year Susquehanna was acquired by Cumulus Media. Along the way, there were dalliances with stunt formats and place holders: Christmas music and TV-show themes for days on end; nothing but construction noises at one point; at another, ‘‘The Lonesome Road,’’ by Dean Elliot & His Big Band, and ‘‘Swans Splashdown,’’ by Jean-Jacques Perrey, played on a loop. Late in 2007, Cumulus switched to the somewhat gross call letters WARM, with 93 hours of commercial-free easy listening and soft-rock. In July 2009, after the station finished 21st in the local ratings, it switched to a Top 40 format and changed its name to i94. Two years later, the station became ‘‘Indy’s i94’’ and added older hits to its mix, thereby becoming hot adult contemporary. ‘‘We’d [flipped] so many times, it was really hard to build a fan base,’’ Morris said. ‘‘We were never anybody’s first choice. We were their fourth choice.’’\n\nMorris and Michaels started talking about what Indianapolis radio needed. The market was saturated: Emmis Radio had country, news/talk, soft adult-contemporary stations and sports; iHeartMedia had classic rock, alternative and sports covered; Radio One had a gospel station, plus three contemporary hits stations; Entercom had two of those, plus sports. One of the ideas the two came up with was a variation on a new format: classic hip-hop, pioneered just a month earlier by a Radio One station in Houston called Boom 92.1. By playing hit ’90s rap records, Boom tripled its audience, and Radio One had begun to duplicate the strategy in other markets.\n\nThe two men brought the idea to Cumulus’s executive vice president of content and programming, John Dickey. Around the same time, Dickey caught word that Radio One was planning to launch a Boom clone in Indianapolis. He was determined to beat them to market. He told Morris to do a ‘‘classic hip-hop holiday weekend,’’ to test listener reaction and stake their claim to the format in Indianapolis.\n\nMichaels dropped the needle on Naughty by Nature’s ‘‘Hip Hop Hooray’’ at 3 p.m. on Dec. 19. LL Cool J’s ‘‘Around the Way Girl’’ followed, then ‘‘Move,’’ by Ludacris. ‘‘We set up a voice-mail box for listener feedback,’’ Michaels said. ‘‘I was expecting lots of complaints. We went from playing Maroon 5 to ‘Me So Horny.’ ’’ The phone rang so much they had to clear the mailbox every day. Callers were ecstatic. The station never returned to its old format.\n\nIn three weeks, 93.9 made the improbable jump from 15th place in Central Indiana to first. Two weeks later, i94 officially became 93.9, the Beat. Ratings for January showed 93.9 with a 7.7 share. It ranked first among people ages 18-34, 18-49 and 25-54; women 18-34, 18-49 and 25-54; and men 18-49 and 25-54. ‘‘Literally nobody in the Top 50 markets in this country has ever done a format change, then in the next full month shot to No. 1,’’ Tom Taylor, the publisher of a popular radio-industry newsletter, told Indianapolis Business Journal. ‘‘Certainly no station in the last decade has done what [WRWM] has.’’ The Beat stole a huge piece of the listenership of Radio One’s top urban stations in Indianapolis, too: WTLC-FM 106.7, ‘‘Indy’s R & B Leader,’’ dropped to 4.5 in January from a 6.6 in December. WHHH-FM 96.3, Radio One’s mainstream urban station, saw its share plummet to 3.9 in January from 5.1 in December. Meanwhile, the Beat’s advertising rates grew by 150 percent.\n\nEver since the earliest days of rock ’n’ roll, time has corroded yesterday’s musical radicalism into today’s pabulum. Thirty years ago, young listeners of hip-hop, with its predilection for violent imagery and unprintable language, might have thought it impervious to this process. But radio conglomerates are proving them wrong. As its listeners grow up and memories of Tipper Gore grow dim, hip-hop is now taking its final step toward respectability: It now qualifies as oldies.\n\nI sat with Jay Michaels one morning this spring while he worked on the Beat’s weekend playlist. His office is tiny, airless and cluttered with Hello Kitty lunchboxes, promotional teddy bears, novelty coffee cups and rubber duckies. On his computer, he had loaded Stratus, Cumulus’s proprietary music-­scheduling software. He pressed a button, and dozens of songs populated a grid on the screen, color-coded in a pattern that Michaels refused to explain. Michaels and Morris are cagey about Stratus, which is used companywide but customized by each station. They refer to the software as their ‘‘secret sauce.’’ What I gleaned through later conversations is that Michaels has broken hip-hop down by region and into subgenres, and the Beat uses these metadata tags to keep its playlist diverse.\n\nOn Cumulus’s version of the format, you’ll never hear back-to-back-to-back Southern rap hits or a cluster of R & B songs with female vocalists; the Beat will break up a block of tunes by harder artists like Ice Cube or DMX with a Mariah Carey track. ‘‘Without flow, this format is a train wreck,’’ Michaels said as he sifted through the computer’s selections, massaging the playlist. ‘‘It’s me being overly anal. I have my own rules.’’ Among them: Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac should never be played back to back (it might call to mind their deadly feud), and a Biggie song should never be played before or after ‘‘I’ll Be Missing You,’’ the tribute song Puff Daddy recorded after Biggie was killed. Michaels also won’t play Outkast next to Ludacris — it just feels weird.\n\nThe Beat is just one of several stations experimenting with the format now, and certainly such rules differ in each city. But the basics of the formula are the same that were developed by Radio One in October. That was the month the company unplugged a failing news station in Houston, 92.1 KROI-FM, dismissed all the employees and started playing Beyoncé songs, commercial-free, 24 hours a day. Beyoncé’s fans — the BeyHive — went bonkers. News outlets from all over the country called with questions about the odd format. On the afternoon of the fifth day, the station paused for a commercial and then played ‘‘Mind Playing Tricks on Me’’ by the Geto Boys, arguably Houston’s most famous contribution to rap music. Notorious B.I.G. followed, then Tupac, then Salt-N-Pepa.\n\nThe early ratings returns were astounding. The station’s audience shot to 802,000 from 245,000, and its Nielsen share went to 3.2 from 1.0. Shortly after that, Radio One started similar stations in Philadelphia and Dallas and saw a gain of 200,000 listeners in each of those cities. Soon, 15 more stations, including 93.9, made the switch.\n\nA cynical but not inaccurate way of thinking about radio formats is as a tool to segment the population for advertisers. Ancient and unglamorous as it may be, radio remains a potent vehicle for advertisers to access consumers. According to a 2015 Nielsen Audio Today report, 91 percent of Americans age 12 or older listen to the radio each week, and the vast majority of those listeners are in the work force (which means they have money to spend). According to another Nielsen study, advertisers achieve more than $6 of incremental sales for every $1 spent on the radio. For radio-station owners, the business plan is simple: Attract the broadest possible audience to your programming and then do everything you can to keep them listening. This is why radio professionals talk about musical genres in ways normal human beings do not; no one believes she listens to rhythmic adult contemporary, but in aggregate, millions of people between the ages of 25 and 54 do.\n\nThe Beat, and stations like it, target listeners in their mid-20s to mid-40s: people who grew up during rap’s golden era. This is a subset of the population that is outgrowing contemporary hip-hop radio (which targets the 18-34 demographic) but is mostly too young to be nostalgic for ’70s and ’80s stations and too hip for adult contemporary. They are also entering the prime spending years of their lives — marriage, children, car buying and homeownership — and radio, like all forms of media, is figuring out how to catch them.\n\nIn a sense, classic hip-hop is following a radio trend that began in the early 1970s, when the first dedicated FM oldies stations started up in Phoenix, playing records by old crooners and doo-wop quartets. The format was a hit, and it quickly spread to Los Angeles and New York, and everywhere else. Oldies reached its zenith in the 1980s, just as classic rock — a new iteration of the same concept — was born. Same story: The format grew as programmers looked for new ways to keep grown-up baby boomers tuned in.\n\nOver the years, people in the radio business have discovered that even these seemingly static formats are quite pliable. Davey Morris told me about B101, a once-venerable oldies station in Providence, R.I. ‘‘When I first started listening, they were playing hits from the ’50s and early ’60s,’’ he said. ‘‘Now they’re playing the Police.’’ The Crests, the Platters and the Chordettes are being shoved aside, saved for Saturday-night specialty shows. At the same time, the leading edge of classic-rock stations continues to slide forward, and many are adding ’90s acts to their rotation: Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Green Day and others. ‘‘If classic rock wasn’t careful, it was going to age itself out of the buying demos,’’ Jon Miller, vice president of audience insights at Nielsen, told me. ‘‘It would be left with an aging audience that isn’t appealing to Madison Avenue.’’\n\nOne person at the Beat told me that the station’s ideal listener is a woman between 35 and 44 who is a homeowner and her family’s decision maker. As of now, around 50 percent of the Beat’s audience is white, 45 percent is black and 4 percent is Hispanic (just 10 percent of Indianapolis is Hispanic). By contrast, the city’s top contemporary hip-hop station, WHHH, has an audience that is 68 percent black, 6 percent Hispanic and around 25 percent white. With the Beat, Dickey said the station had achieved universal likability. ‘‘The format is multicultural,’’ he said. ‘‘Anybody — black, white or Hispanic — can claim ownership of this music.’’\n\nThough they’re in the odd position of creating something like a canon for rap music, Morris and the other programmers I spoke with made it clear that they don’t see themselves as stewards of the genre. Their job is to play the hits. Morris, in particular, is looking forward to the summer, when he thinks the Beat’s true potential will be realized. ‘‘People are going to drive around with their windows down and this music blasting,’’ he said. ‘‘They’re going to play it at the beach and at parties. It’s going to be like popcorn and bonbons: We’re just going to keep feeding them hits.’’\n\nToday, that’s easier than ever. Using something called a Portable People Meter, which looks like a beeper, Nielsen collects listening data from its survey participants by detecting hidden tones in a station’s audio stream. The meters can tell which station the panelists are listening to, whether they’re at home or away and how long a listener stays on a station. Independent analysts can provide even more granular data than that, allowing radio programmers to gauge which songs people respond well to and which tracks push them to change the station.\n\nNielsen recently analyzed four months’ worth of airplay data at 11 new classic hip-hop stations all over the country (including Boom), from Philadelphia to the San Francisco Bay Area, to determine the Top 50 songs in the format. The songs cover the 13 years from 1991 to 2004, with a pronounced feel-good bent and subtle West Coast bias. The Top 5 are: Luniz, ‘‘I Got 5 on It’’; Ice Cube, ‘‘It Was a Good Day’’; Snoop Doggy Dogg, ‘‘Gin and Juice’’; Notorious B.I.G., ‘‘One More Chance’’; and 50 Cent, ‘‘In Da Club.’’ Tupac’s ‘‘How Do U Want It,’’ ‘‘I Get Around’’ and ‘‘California Love’’ are in the Top 25; his more barbed songs, like ‘‘Brenda’s Got a Baby’’ and ‘‘2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted,’’ aren’t even in the Top 50. The Wu-Tang Clan is represented only by Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s crossover hit ‘‘Got Your Money.’’ Somehow, Chingy’s ‘‘Right Thurr’’ has the No. 33 spot.\n\nThere has always been a tension in hip-hop between those songs that are made for radio play and songs that were made for the real fans. But the classic hip-hop format seems to act like a sieve that catches only the most radio-friendly of the past’s radio-friendly records. Take, for example, ‘‘It Was a Good Day.’’ That song wasn’t even Ice Cube’s biggest hit in 1993, the year it came out; ‘‘Check Yo Self’’ was. But ‘‘Check Yo Self’’ is a song typical of early ’90s Ice Cube — angry and violent, with jokes about S.T.D.s, guns and prison rape — and ‘‘Good Day’’ is downright happy go lucky. In it, Ice Cube eats a halal breakfast; wins at basketball, dice and dominoes; and sees his name written in lights on the Goodyear blimp.\n\nIn May, I visited WRWM and sat in on its drive-time program. Notorious B.I.G.’s ‘‘Juicy’’ played as we approached the 3 o’clock hour. Manning the boards was Zack Babb, a.k.a. Zakk, who hosts a show, weekdays from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. Zakk, who is 27, tall and blond, wore board shorts and canvas sneakers and spent his downtime watching the traffic on Interstate 465 out the window. He watches it stack up every day, he told me. He seemed thrilled by it.\n\nThere are just three on-air personalities at the Beat, including Zakk, who did just about everything but decide which song came next. While the music played, he recorded and edited the other elements that go into radio: sweepers, bumpers, ramps, promos. In preparation for a prescheduled spin of Mark Morrison’s ‘‘Return of the Mack,’’ Zakk recorded a ramp: ‘‘Remember hearing this one at United Skates of America? Some guys at the rink used to do a cool backward shuffle to this song. Every time I tried it, I fell on my butt.’’ (Roller-skating, he explained to me, was huge in and around Indianapolis in the 1990s.)\n\nAs hours in the studio glided by, so did the utterly irresistible blend of rap and R & B hits: Outkast’s ‘‘Hey Ya!’’ led to Wreckx-N-Effect’s ‘‘Rump Shaker.’’ Then Keith Sweat’s ‘‘Make You Sweat’’ played into Coolio’s ‘‘Fantastic Voyage.’’ When ‘‘Still Fly,’’ by Big Tymers, came on, Zakk fondly recalled blowing out his dad’s speakers as a kid. Each hour was announced by a new classic hip-hop standard. At 4 p.m., it was Tupac and Dr. Dre’s ‘‘California Love.’’ At 5, as traffic on Interstate 465 slowed, it was Jay Z and UGK’s ‘‘Big Pimpin’.’’ Snoop took us into cocktail hour with ‘‘Gin and Juice’’ at 6.\n\nThe traffic on the Interstate had halted by then, and I marveled out loud at the symmetry of the scene. We were sitting in a radio station, gazing out at people held prisoner with nothing to do but listen. I asked Zakk to look out the window and tell me the first thing that came to mind. He grinned widely and said, earnestly: ‘‘I imagine all of those people in their cars dancing.’’\n\nA version of this article appears in print on July 19, 2015, on page MM26 of the Sunday Magazine with the headline: Back in the Day.

Lot's to talk about including the unfortunate (alleged) Jon Gosselin affair, Paula Abdul's sudden admission of a painkiller addiction and Lindsay Lohan... just because. Oh, and looking ahead to Saturday night's White House Correspondents Dinner. Though after the star-studded inauguration we went through only a few months back, the WHCA Dinner doesn't seem like as big of a deal this year. We'll see -- I did hear a rumor that Tom Cruise may show up and, much to Jen Chaney's delight, Jason Bateman will be in attendance. Here's a list of all the star power expected to be on hand -- so far. Let's get started...\n\nPossum Island: Dear Liz, I've been thinking lately about the whole celeb/famous person privacy/publicity balance. Specifically Elizabeth Edwards's book and Sara Jessica/Matthew B.'s surrogate thing. I mean, obviously these are public figures, and anything that happens to them is news. Mrs. Edwards's husband confessed to his affair publicly. Does it then follow that Mrs. Edwards writes a book about it? And I'm happy for SJ/MB, but now of course everyone wants to know who the surrogate is, and her family is under the microscope.\n\nAfter having \"exposed\" themselves, will they all eventually say, \"I'm a victim of the media/paparazzi?\" What do you think? Thanks.\n\nLiz Kelly: This is a well-thought out query. I'll do my best to make some sense here. This goes back to the whole privacy line debate we had here last week and have talked about several times over the years. There is definitely a line and, yes, certain sectors of the press can be a bit overzealous in their pursuit of private details about the lives of public figures. It sucks, but it comes with the territory. Which is why I am still somewhat amazed by people who enter into public life -- be it a politician or an actor -- and then proceed to leave themselves wide open to the vipers who are always waiting in the wings hoping for a hot scoop. At this point one has to know it comes with the territory. It may not be right, but there it is. And as absurd as some of this stuff is -- Star Magazine, ahem -- it is part of the price of having a free press and that's not something I'm willing to trade in. I think the Elizabeth Edwards book is a different issue. We're still in the privacy realm, but I'm tempted to say that the issue with Edwards is more about profiting from pain -- her own, her husbands, her childrens' and that of the supposed Edwards love child. Maureen Dowd said it better: But it's just a gratuitous peek into their lives, and one that exposes her kids, by peddling more dregs about their personal family life in a book, and exposes the ex-girlfriend who's now trying to raise the baby girl, a dead ringer for John Edwards, in South Orange, N.J. I have a lot of respect for Elizabeth Edwards and think she could have written a compelling worthwhile book without inflicting more pain. Is it a violation of privacy? Yes. But I suppose if anyone is entitled to violate it, then it is Elizabeth herself.\n\nLiz Kelly: RE: SJP's surrogate, apparently she's been unmasked as something of a wild child. And here's a link to the Maureen Dowd column referenced above.\n\nThrow your sister under the bus for Us Weekly: Who knows if Jon Gosselin is cheating or not - but that guy who who claims his sister is the mistress is as bad as the loser who ratted out Michael Phelps with the pot pics. Something tells me it is going to be a very unhappy Thanksgiving at the bro and sis house this year.\n\nLiz Kelly: That family kind of loses either way, eh?\n\nThe ballad of Kiefer Sutherland: Clearly KS has issues. The intriguing/confusing aspect to the story is the weirdness coming out of Brooke Shields' camp - her reps say they don't know why Kiefer headbutted the designer, but they also claim ignorance on whether she was pushed or whatever. (If they are authorized to speak for her, you would think they would get the full story first.)\n\nwashingtonpost.com: EW: Brooke Shields' rep contradicts Kiefer Sutherland\n\nLiz Kelly: Three years ago Tom Cruise almost lost his career trying to save Brooke Shields from antidepressants. Now Kiefer Sutherland is charged with assault for defending her honor and may end up back in jail. A coincidence or is Brooke Shields the unlucky tiki of the celebrity set?\n\nAndrew Morton's Angelina book: Rarely do I believe anything Star magazine says, but surely if their story is accurate Morton should have a monster libel case on his hands.\n\nThe first line of the cover story from this week's issue reads, \"Angelina Jolie is a jealous, cunning liar who cheated on Brad with a famous rock star, schemed to lure him away from Jennifer Aniston -- and even slept with her own mother's boyfriend!\"\n\nLiz Kelly: Hot diggity! That sounds like good summer beach reading.\n\nJon Gossel, IN: I've watched the show some. Their kids have the same age spread as mine and on a smaller level, I can relate to their trials and tribulations.\n\nSo last week, I stumbled into the land of Kate Hate. It's a rough and tumble land, current capital, Detroit. But this week, the details are coming out about Jon.\n\nWow. Who in their right mind would sign up for a reality show when their personal life is falling apart?\n\nOh, I'm sorry, I believe Bobby Brown, Hulk Hogan, and several \"Real Housewives\" have already answered that question.\n\nIf I were Kate, I would say, \"Go have your affair...only you have to have it with Nadya Suleman.\"\n\nLiz Kelly: Again, this goes back to the question of private details about public lives. And while I don't have any emotional investment in either Jon or Kate (tho the eight are pretty irresistible), I'm sorry to see their dirty laundry being aired so publicly. Two things to remember: Specific to this case: We don't know that Jon actually had an affair, although it probably wasn't the best idea for him to go clubbing with some woman who is not his wife. In general: Humans are fallible. Even humans who score TV contracts or recording deals or walk red carpets and make millions of dollars a year.\n\nFunny-ish story: I'm on the elevator and two middle-aged men get on. One guy keeps saying, \"I think it was Renee Zellweger\" and other is like, \"Really, was it like 10 minutes?\" At this point, I'm like, what are these people talking about in the elevator? Then they go quiet and when they are about to get off the elevator, one guy says, \"I think it was Kirsten Dunst.\" The other says, \"No, I'm pretty sure it was Renee Zellweger.\"\n\n\"Wasn't it for like 5 minutes or a couple of hours?\" \"Nah, I think we're talking months here...\"\n\nI finally realized they were talking about a quickie marriage. Definitely Renee, not Kirsten, yes?\n\nLiz Kelly: Oh, definitely Renee. Has anyone out there seen \"Apaloosa?\" A perfectly good Western utterly ruined by Renee Zellweger. Even Kirsten Dunst would have been an improvement.\n\nishkabible: The Daily Beast, a mostly intellectual online news source, had a 3-page article about Heincer. I was devastated. It was like discovering the ants you thought were ONLY in your kitchen are now in the upstairs bed room.\n\nI thought about forwarding it to you Liz, for gems like, \"The paparazzi are like family members to us\" and \"You're gonna have to pry Speidi's fame from our dead hands.\" But THEN I read: \"a post about me gets like 2,000 of the most evil comments. But I'm motivated by those reactions....They keep me going. It's juice. It's power. Persecute me, please.\"\n\nWell played, you little prat.\n\nI put the matter before Liz, Producer Paul, and the collective wisdom of the Celebritology community. Would it be better to engage in the snarkfest Heincer so RICHLY deserves, or pretend we didn't notice them?\n\nThe article in question: The Speidi Chronicles\n\nLiz Kelly: It's a lose-lose situation. Actually, maybe even lose-lose-lose.\n\nKiefer, continued: What I find interesting about this whole kerfuffle is that Brooke Shields has to be substantially taller than Kiefer. I know he's Jack Bauer and all but how exactly does she need defending from a designer?\n\nLiz Kelly: Well, tall doesn't necessarily mean strong. But I would guess the difference is actually that Brooke Shields has some self control.\n\nWHCA Dinner : Jon Hamm and John Cusack?! Dear gawd...I need a ticket...\n\nLiz Kelly: Yes -- and although I'm not getting fully decked out (I'll be working, after all) my get-up is totally \"Mad Men\"-esque. I'm sure that'll make all the difference.\n\nCollege Radio: I teach at the school that hosts a radio station I've been listening to since I moved to the area. I have a total girl-crush on the station manager, the way the Fug-girls have a crush on Kelly Clarkson (\"hey let's go have hot wings and drink beer and talk about boys!\") But beyond our mutual employer, I have NO reason to start up a conversation or even run into her. (I teach night classes and don't really see other faculty or even go to department meetings.)\n\nSo aside from walking into the station and saying \"hey! You don't know me, but you seem like you kick ass. Wanna have lunch?\" what is the least creepiest way I can meet this person? (I know this is sort of a Haxian question, but it's about a LOCAL celebrity, so I'm hoping you'll take it.)\n\nLiz Kelly: I'm going to open this up for suggestions... me, I'm not convinced there's a way to do this that won't seem weird. Anything I can think of just seems way too forced. I do feel your pain, though. I have totally been there. And I still think Russell Crowe and I would get along really well.\n\nJason Bateman: Compared to his sister Justine, who started out on the very successful Family Ties series, Jason (who I first remember seeing in \"Teen Wolf, Too\") seems to have trod a much happier career path, playing nicely etched roles in movies like \"Juno\" and \"State of Play.\" Is he leading man material? I don't know -- not sure he takes himself that seriously.\n\nLiz Kelly: I think he's leading man material and I don't think he has to take himself seriously to move into that territory. And although \"Arrested Development\" was an ensemble show, it could be argued that Jason led that ensemble. I first remember him, btw, from \"Family Ties,\" on which he showed up from time to time as a friend of Ricky's. Along with Alfonso Ribiero (whose name I am probably butchering).\n\nBrad and Jen Meet-Up?: What do you make of this tale? Who has a movie coming out momentarily? (other than \"Ben Button\" on DVD)\n\nLiz Kelly: If memory serves, that particular \"story\" originated in Star Magazine, which -- as far as I can tell -- is written using Mad Libs books and a rotating list of celebrity names.\n\nDork, Us: Okay, so I come out of two month Celebritology exile to find that Lilo and Jon Mayer are single again, as well as Farrah Fawcett having anal cancer, and Dom Delouise died. What other major events have I missed? Can I get a pic of Scarlet Johansson?\n\nLiz, I think I'm getting Scarletted out. We might need to retire her and solicit replacement ideas.\n\nLiz Kelly: I never thought I'd see the day when Paul tired of ScarJo. I'm curious as to who is on his kitchen list now. Bai Ling? Megan Fox? What did you miss? Hmm -- I'm assuming you know about Mel Gibson's divorce and young Russian girlfriend.\n\nBawlmer, Hon: Thanks for the WHCD guest list! Do you know how one obtains tickets to the dinner? Was there any infighting this year over who got tickets and who didn't? And how is Ashton Kutcher going under CNN's name? Strange.\n\nLiz Kelly: News organizations buy tables and distribute the tickets as they see fit -- to people within the org and guests, who tend to be celebs and politicians. I won't actually be heading into the dinner, but instead covering the much more interesting pre-parties that basically take over every inch of the Hilton on Saturday eve.\n\nMore Keifer and Brooke: If the designer Keifer assaulted was responsible for the \"hat\" Brooke Sheilds wore to the Kentucky Derby, then he deserved a headbutt.\n\nwashingtonpost.com: No joke. She looks like something from \"Super Mario Brothers.\"\n\nLiz Kelly: That whole outfit is just wrong. Though I rarely see a star who can carry off a hat well. Some recent examples of stars who can: Drew Barrymore, Aretha Franklin. Usually, though, they just look like kids playing dress up. Why is that? Women used to look stunning in hats.\n\nKal Penn: What are the chances of getting Kal to do a WashPost chat? He clearly has a huge fan base amongst the chatters, he could use it as a platform to discuss whatever the White House wants him to discuss, and a producer would be able to screen out all of the phone numbers and virtual panties.\n\nwashingtonpost.com: This would depend on my competence and professionalism. So, slim.\n\nLiz Kelly: Paul is fishing for compliments. He knows he is a rock star. As for Kal, I'm guessing it wouldn't be out of the question to get him online. But, remember, the White House Web site does their own version of online chats so they may want him chatting exclusively on the administration's site.\n\nQuatch: Liz, Who is the MC for the White House Correspondents Dinner? I didn't see Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Lewis Black or any other Comedy Central people in the guest list. Did I overlook them?\n\nLiz Kelly: It's Wanda Sykes -- hometown girl made good. She used to work for the NSA, though I'm not sure what her job entailed.\n\n15th and L: Were you there when Stephen Colbert spoke at the White House Correspondents dinner a couple years ago? I have loved him ever since. Best line of the night, \"Now, I know there are some polls out there saying this man has a 32 percent approval rating. But guys like us, we don't pay attention to the polls. We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in 'reality'. And reality has a well-known liberal bias.\"\n\nwashingtonpost.com: Interesting address, 15th and L.\n\nColbert Roasts President Bush - 2006 White House Correspondents Dinner\n\nLiz Kelly: That was the one I missed, sadly. Though I watched on C-SPAN -- which is, arguably, a better experience anyhow.\n\nJason Bateman: \"Family Ties\" -- of course, you meant \"Silver Spoons.\"\n\nJustine actually quit acting for a long time, and only recently came back to it. She had a role on \"Desperate Housewives\" a couple of seasons ago, and did something else recently that is escaping me at the moment...\n\nLiz Kelly: Yes, I meant \"Silver Spoons.\" My mind is much from staying up until the wee hours writing \"Lost\" analysis. Non-fans will be pleased to learn that next week is the last episode until January 2010.\n\nWashington, DC: Come on Liz! We all know know that you had a front row seat for the biggest celebrity scoop of the week. So, spill it. How was the reunion between Page and Sally? Pictures! We want pictures.\n\nLiz Kelly: There was a pic in the article. Honestly, we didn't get many. It was raining and we were trying to wrangle two dogs and cameras at the same time. Page isn't usually too friendly with other dogs, but she was okay with Sally. I think Sally was just calm enough to not set Page on edge. Sally, btw, is a total sweetheart.\n\nCollege Radio:: Friend her on Facebook. Add a message about how you work there too and love her show. Over time, become friendly online. Eventually you can ask her \"out.\" It's like online dating, only weirder. wink.\n\nLiz Kelly: That's a thought... Facebook does seem to breed an odd kind of intimacy.\n\nJason Bateman and Alfonso Ribeiro: You meant, \"Silver Spoons,\" right? Now I've got that theme song in my head for the rest of the afternoon!\n\nwashingtonpost.com: I'll trade you for the \"Family Ties\" theme.\n\nLiz Kelly: Last night Jen Chaney and I both had the \"Macgruber\" theme stuck in our heads. It was painful.\n\nWashington, DC: I am obsessed with Twilight and Robert Pattinson. Alas, I am no teenager -- in my forties, married with kids. Can you help me?\n\nLiz Kelly: Does it help to know you are not alone and that there are legions of 30-something and 40-something women crushing on Pattinson? Speaking of which, Weingarten claims my mini-crush on Michael Cera is wholly age inappropriate.\n\nLiz Kelly: And just so we don't give the cats short shrift, here's a short video of Andy. The sound is bad and the camera work shaky, but that hasn't stopped me from watching it three or four times already.\n\nWashington, D.C.: Can I please have a picture of Andy. The guy I've been dating just told me his feelings for me faded while I am totally in to him. Yes, I am very aware of how pathetic this request is, but my cat lives 2,500 miles away with my mom. And, I can't even claim that I'm in college. She just choose her when I moved years ago. Oh, God. I'm that girl. Andy! Please! Stat!\n\nLiz Kelly: Oh no -- I'm glad I posted that video. You need it. And I know I'm biased, but Andy's better than your loser ex anyway.\n\nPrince Harry: I read that he is going to have an official USA visit this summer. Any chance he is coming to the DC area?\n\nLiz Kelly: I can't imagine he'd come all the way across the pond without a visit to the White House, but I haven't seen any details yet.\n\nKal Penn: Did you see the press release about the \"Harold and Kumar\" Christmas movie that will come out in 2010? I need details as to how that is working.\n\nIn other news, my life has been a little better now that Kal Penn has started tweeting more.\n\nLiz Kelly: I actually talked about that with Kal and John Cho when I interviewed them at ComicCon last July. Apparently the company that owns the \"Harold and Kumar\" franchise announced plans for a new movie last summer, but hadn't yet bothered to secure either Kal or John for the film. And, according to IMDB, the project still doesn't have any talent attached.\n\nAndy, Feline Valentino?: If I were a girl cat, I would be totally crushing on Andy. That come-hither look and mysterious smile; the guy wouldn't even need to show up with a nosegay of catnip...\n\nLiz Kelly: I know. It's ridiculous. And that white patch of hair on his chest/neck totally looks like he's wearing a dress shirt or a dickie. He's just naturally debonair.\n\nPossum Island: Re: College Radio,\n\nHave you actually seen this person? Because I once had a blind date with a DJ that I had only heard on radio/talked to on the phone, and man was I disappointed (actually frightened is more like it!)\n\nLiz Kelly: Wasn't that a movie?\n\nJason Bateman: Not Family Ties, Silver Spoons. And I had a crush on him more than Rick(y) Schroeder. Plus, he was on \"Little House on the Prairie\" and had a short-lived but brilliant sitcom called \"It's Your Move.\" I'm no longer a stalker.\n\nLiz Kelly: Just to make sure -- I did clarify that I meant \"Silver Spoons,\" yes?\n\nPage and Sally!: I had a similar experience with my family's dog, Jeter. I volunteer with a rescue in the are, and my parents brought him to visit, socialize and get microchipped. While we were there, another couple walks up with their dog. Zeno was the spitting image of Jeter, just lankier and 15lbs lighter.\n\nIn more celebritological news, any good locales for celeb-watching this weekend?\n\nwashingtonpost.com: When you play ball with Jeter, does he have to play extra deep because he's lost a step and can no longer make routine plays?\n\nLiz Kelly: A sports joke. In my chat. I'm going to cry. As for celeb watching, the Hilton is the prime spot. Usually there is a roped off fan area set up along the red carpet. But judging from years past, it is loaded with teenaged girls. So, be warned.\n\nWeingarten claims my mini-crush on Michael Cera is wholly age inappropriate. : He's 26! You're fine!\n\nLiz Kelly: Ehrm, no. He's 20.\n\nNo man, No Cat, D.C.: Thank you. That was enough. I can finish my work today.\n\nLiz Kelly: Well, at least wait until 2 p.m. to get started.\n\nBernie Madoff: The Movie: I'm thinking an old-time SNL reunion feature. Jon Lovitz as Madoff, Jane Curtin as the wife, and Nora Dunn as the newly surfaced tell-all assistant. (Lovitz already played the villain in the sendup of \"It's A Wonderful Life,\" so he has the role down pat.)\n\nwashingtonpost.com: Wow, I had forgotten this was the episode Shatner hosted!\n\nLiz Kelly: I love that clip -- we showed that one last December in Weingarten's chat, too. It never gets old.\n\nHouston: Thanks for letting us bend your ear -as an alum of a Kentucky university, I have to set the record straight on the Brooke Shields hat thing - the traditional thing for high society women to do at the Kentucky Derby is to wear an ornate, over the top, hat. And the Derby is about nothing, if not tradition. Sort of like at some churches, ladies wear really elaborate headgear. So, as for the hat, Brooke was just doing in Rome what the Romans do.\n\nLiz Kelly: But \"ornate, over the top\" does not necessarily have to mean \"ugly,\" does it?\n\nQuery: Can we qualify any future Lindsay Lohan work as \"having no talent attached\"?\n\nJustine actually quit acting for a long time: She was battling anorexia.\n\nLiz Kelly: That must have been after \"Satisfaction,\" in which she played the leader of an all girl beach band who was romancing a music producer played by Liam Neeson.\n\nBrooke Shields: And Andre Agassi didn't start winning again until after they split!\n\nLiz Kelly: The plot thickens.\n\nBai Ling? Megan Fox? : No and No. I vote for Rachel Bilson. Mena from \"That 70s Show.\"\n\nwashingtonpost.com: I think you mean Mila Kunis from \"That '70s Show\"? Or do you mean Mila in addition to Rachel? I'm confused.\n\nI'm leaning toward Robin Scherbatsky.\n\nlegions of 30-something and 40-something women crushing on Pattinson? : You think that's bad? I know a married mother in her 50s who belongs to an online fan club for adult fans of Hanson. Owe the humanity!\n\nwashingtonpost.com: I don't know if that's at typo or pun.\n\nLiz Kelly: It's a pun, Paul. A longtime entry in the Official Celebritology Glossary. Can I just say that I came into the building today to work because I have a few meetings. I went to the trouble of reserving a conference room so I could have my accustomed solitude while chatting. Too bad there's some kind of morale building sales meeting in the next conference room over. I think there may be role-playing and team building happening. It sounds like Grand Central Station.\n\nre: Pattinson: I, too, am struggling with an age inappropriate crush on Pattinson. Read some of the interviews he's done where he admits his total paranoia about being overwhelmed by fans or getting stabbed by someone in a crowd. GQ's interview was great. He seems to be someone who truly regrets becoming famous. Admittedly, I still have a crush on him, but now I feel BAD about it.\n\n(And you are right on about Cera. Tell Gene to shut his mouth.)\n\nwashingtonpost.com: GQ: HE'S HOT, HE'S SEXY, HE'S UNDEAD\n\nLiz Kelly: Thank you and thank you.\n\nOlney, MD: FYI: Justine Bateman was last seen in several episodes of \"Men in Trees\" at the end of its first season which became the shows second season because of the writers strike. ABC canceled the series last season.\n\nLiz Kelly: Thank you -- and Producer Paul reminds me that Julia Roberts was also in \"Satisfaction.\"\n\nBrooke Shields: You know, if Brooke had added a couple more inches to her Derby outfit, no one would be taking about it. It looks like it's 2 sizes too small - not that she doesn't fit in it, but that the waist is too high, the v neck too low and the hemline too high.\n\nLiz Kelly: Dress too small, hat too big.\n\nBoston: Just want to say that \"Ick. Nast\" is my new quote of the summer. Stay classy, Jon's alleged's mistresses' brother!\n\n(My other quote is \"Stay out of it Nick Lachey!\" thanks to the Soup. Do you watch it? I love it).\n\nLiz Kelly: Yes. I watch and love. And \"Stay out of it, Nick Lachey\" was classic.\n\nNer,DO: Just throwing this out there, but Justine Batement played a hooker on Arrested Development who tried to pickup Jason Bateman's character and ended up being his sister. The episode was titled Family Ties. I think it was one of the last episodes of the show.\n\nAnd yes, I'm already in line for the opening of the movie.\n\nLiz Kelly: That must have been in the third season -- which Mr. Liz and I started watching, but soon stopped after we realized there had been a serious decline in quality. Does it get better again?\n\nReplacement: Easy: Minka Kelley - shes going to be in DC for a while now too!\n\nwashingtonpost.com: I'm not even sure she's the best looking woman on \"Friday Night Lights.\" I'll take Mrs. Coach.\n\nNew Crush for Producer Paul: Miss California\n\nwashingtonpost.com: She is what an ex-roommate of mine referred to as \"Dirty Hot.\"\n\nLiz Kelly: What is this, Maxim online?\n\nFalls Church, Va.: I'm sorry but I just don't get the appeal of Jennifer Garner. She's not very pretty (the angular face, puffy lips, stick out ears.....maybe pretty for an average woman but not a movie star). And then starring in awful AWFUL movies like \"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past\"...tell me, what's her appeal? Is she the luckiest woman on Earth to be so famous or what?\n\nwashingtonpost.com: For guys, I posit it begins with the post 2006 Super Bowl episode of \"Alias\" where she beat up a plane full of bad guys in her underwear.\n\nShe was the one in her underwear, to clarify.\n\nLiz Kelly: I think she's attractive. She's not classically beautiful, but she's got an interesting angular face and she's in fab shape. Much like Hillary Swank. And don't forget that in addition to \"dirty hot,\" there's also what we dubbed \"ugly pretty\" a couple of years back. People who are somehow not all that attractive, but you crush on them for some unknown reason. Vincent Gallo is one of these for me.\n\nJulia Roberts: So last night I was watching Green Day do American Idiot for VH1 Storytellers or whatever it's called, and at the end, there was a DMB video for a song called \"Dreamgirl\" and Julia Roberts was in it. (I may be wholly behind the times here, but I rarely watch \"music\" tv.) I just thought that was kind of weird, and doesn't she have better things to do?\n\nAlso, ever since I saw Dave Matthews play a gifted but retarded man on \"House\" I can't help but think of him in that role at all times.\n\nLiz Kelly: That song and vid are a few years old, right?\n\nJust Curious: Why was the item about the passing of Stanley Tucci's wife in the \"Rumor Mill\" section of today's column? Seems he confirmed it to the NY Post.\n\nLiz Kelly: The version I saw was not confirmed. And the only other place I could find the story was Contact Music, which was a direct pull of the NY Post blurb. Maybe they've since updated?\n\nQuestion for the ages: Liz, which one of your chats do you love the most? (almost as bad as asking which pet you love the most)\n\nLiz Kelly: I love all of my chats equally, though for different reasons.\n\nWanda Sykes for the White House Correspondants: Isn't that a little too obvious? Black president so we have to get a black comedian to MC? Having said that, she is hilarious.\n\nLiz Kelly: I think you're reading a little too much into this. Carm down.\n\nLiz Kelly: Okay -- apologies, but I need to run to the loo before I switch gears for the \"Lost\" chat. See you here next week and in the blog tomorrow.\n\nEditor's Note: washingtonpost.com moderators retain editorial control over Discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions. washingtonpost.com is not responsible for any content posted by third parties.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nLiz Kelly: Afternoon and welcome to today's really big show.

She is still in good health. But when it happens, we both know that she wants above all to die quickly and without pain. She wants no heroic measures. Because my brother and I know this, and because she has the proper legal documents, she is likely to die as she wishes.\n\nMy mother is unusual. Not in what she wants — a Pew Research Center study indicates that 57 percent of Americans would ask their doctor to stop treatment so they could die if they had an incurable disease and were suffering a great deal of pain. What sets my mom apart is that she has been unafraid to talk to us about her wishes.\n\nMost Americans don’t do that. Of adults 75 and over, the study found that only 17 percent had talked to their families about their end-of-life wishes. It is an uncomfortable conversation. It always seems too early to talk to a loved one about how she wants to die — until it’s too late, and she can no longer make decisions for herself.\n\nBut perhaps soon, more Americans will be like my mom. On Jan. 1, Medicare will begin reimbursing doctors and other health professionals for time spent talking to patients about their end-of-life wishes. This is a big deal, but far from enough. End-of-life conversations need to become something families just do.\n\nThere’s one place in America like that now: La Crosse, Wis.\n\nLa Crosse started down this path in 1984, when Bernard Hammes, a philosopher by training, was hired as director of medical humanities at the Gundersen Lutheran Medical Foundation. His job was to work with medical personnel to improve their skills and help them make decisions in ethically fraught situations.\n\nIn one two-month period, Hammes saw three very elderly patients who had suffered devastating strokes and kidney failure, were being kept alive with dialysis, and could not speak for themselves. If the doctors stopped dialysis, the patients would die. But even on dialysis, the patients would never recover from their strokes.\n\n“None of the families had ever talked with the parent about the parent’s perspective on dialysis and when to stop,” Hammes said. “Families were going to have to live with the question of ‘did I do the right thing for my mom or father?’ and they would never know the answer.” These patients had not gotten sick suddenly. They had long, progressive illnesses and had been in care at Gundersen for years — and no one had thought to begin that conversation.\n\nThe lack of communication is often catastrophic for patients who do not want heroic measures. When family members don’t know a relative’s wishes, they often feel they must show their love by asking that everything be done. Anything short of the maximum seems like abandonment or betrayal.\n\nAnd that makes the choice also terrible for families. “I witnessed frequent and repeated moral distress that health professionals and families had making decisions when there were no good decisions,” Hammes said. “It was almost exclusively based on the fact that we didn’t know what the patient wanted.”\n\nResearch shows that families who are unaware of a patient’s wishes suffer much more stress, anxiety and depression than those who are aware. “It was a difference of night and day,” said Hammes. “The difference it makes in people’s lives is so clear and big that not to do it seems cruel.”\n\nHammes started a program to begin end-of-life conversations with dialysis patients and their families. Within two years, he said, almost all the families of dialysis patients knew their loved one’s wishes.\n\nIn 1991, Gundersen set up a task force to spread the program throughout La Crosse, which included the Franciscan Hospital and the Skemp Clinic, alongside the Gundersen Lutheran Medical Foundation’s hospital and clinic. All four collaborated, along with nursing homes, hospices and smaller hospitals.\n\nThe goal was not simply to have people fill out an advance directive and put it in their medical records. A written directive alone, members of the task force reasoned, could do more harm than good if it came as a surprise to the family, said Hammes. “We don’t think mom understood what she signed,” was a common response.\n\nJust as important as the legal document was a conversation with the patient and her family. The patient would need to understand the options — for example, that “do everything necessary to keep me alive” can mean intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which on a frail elderly person can break her ribs and sternum; those who survive it often do so with abdominal bleeding and neurological damage. And the family had to agree to support the patient’s decisions.\n\n“We really changed the nature of the question,” said Hammes. “It’s not: ‘How do you fill out this legal document,’ but ‘What does good care look like if you become ill and may not recover?’ At the most basic human level, what families face in those moments is, ‘What does it mean to love my mom or dad when they’re not going to recover, but we could still do some things to keep them alive? What does it mean to take good care of my mom at this point?’”\n\nThe task force brought its message to local churches, senior centers and community groups. Inside health care organizations, it became evident that doctors didn’t have time for these conversations, but also that doctors weren’t required. Instead, the task force trained nurses, social workers and chaplains.\n\nToday, Hammes said, 96 percent of people who die in La Crosse County have had a conversation with relatives about how they want to spend their last days, and those wishes have been entered into their electronic medical records.\n\nRead previous contributions to this series.\n\nPresident Obama tried to include reimbursement for end-of-life conversations in the Affordable Care Act. Sarah Palin derailed it with a single Facebook post: “The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama’s ‘death panel’ so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their “level of productivity in society,” whether they are worthy of health care.” With that, she gave a rallying cry to the anti-ObamaCare right. Palin’s post won PolitiFact’s 2009 “Lie of the Year” award.\n\nA year later, the Obama administration tried again to cover advance care planning decisions. Again, it proved too politically toxic.\n\nToday the political climate has improved. Advance care planning is no longer coupled to Obamacare, and Medicare’s decision to cover end-of-life conversations will have a ripple effect. Some private insurers already cover these conversations, and when Medicare starts, the rest will most likely follow. Last Thursday, WPS Health Solutions, Wisconsin’s largest nonprofit insurer, announced that its WPS Health Insurance and Arise Health Plan would begin to cover advance care planning conversations as of September.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, has introduced legislation each year to reimburse and encourage care planning conversations, on a scale going beyond what Medicare is proposing. This year, his Care Planning Act has three Democratic and three Republican original co-sponsors and the endorsement of dozens of organizations.\n\nThe issue is personal for Warner. His mother had Alzheimer’s disease for 11 years before her death in 2010, and during the last eight or nine years she didn’t speak. “My father and sister took care of my mom 24/7 at home with a little bit of extra help until the last week or two,” he said. “I was a well-informed citizen” — exceedingly so; for much of that time he was governor of the state — “but we never had the conversation in our own family. Even though both of Mom’s parents had Alzheimer’s, we never sat down with my mom and asked her and thought this fully through. It is not always the easiest thing to talk through.”\n\nGunderson has bundled its strategies, training curriculum and materials into a package called Respecting Choices, which, according to Hammes, is being used in about 125 American hospitals and several other countries. The program is also being studied in a randomized control trial with sites in six European countries.\n\nOthers are now spreading Gundersen’s program. Minnesota was the first of a half-dozen states to establish a program called Honoring Choices. One other was Wisconsin; John Maycroft, the director of policy development and initiatives at the Wisconsin Medical Society, said that Honoring Choices Wisconsin works with 28 health care organizations — covering about half the state’s patients — to train staff to use Respecting Choices. The group also helps health care organizations make these conversations a part of routine care — for example, by finding a physician to champion it at each site. It trains advocates for it in community settings like churches, and makes videos for Wisconsin public television.\n\nAs Respecting Choices spreads, it encounters a major obstacle that was not present in La Crosse. At Gundersen and the other founding organizations, doctors and other staff members did not (and still do not) bill for each procedure, a system called fee-for-service. Instead, they draw salaries. This mattered because insurers and Medicare don’t reimburse health care personnel for having these conversations — it’s unbillable time. Because staff members in La Crosse are largely salaried, that’s not an issue for them.\n\nBut fee-for-service does matter on another level, even in La Crosse: Having end-of-life conversations often results in patients choosing less invasive health care. Gundersen spends less than the vast majority of American hospitals to care for inpatients in the last two years of their life; in 2010, for example, its spending was 40 percent below the national average. (The end-of-life conversations were not the only factor, but they were undoubtedly a major one.)\n\nSince the last two years of life for patients with chronic illness are responsible for a third of Medicare’s costs, eliminating unwanted invasive care is great for taxpayers. But it’s not as great for hospitals, which take in less money if they can’t fill those beds. Although hospitals are switching slowly — too slowly — to value-based medicine, which pays according to quality, not quantity, of care, most hospitals still have a perverse incentive to provide as much medical care as possible.\n\nEven so, many fee-for-service hospitals are beginning to adopt advance care planning. “So many clinicians have the experience of performing CPR on a 90-year-old woman with heart disease,” said Maycroft. “They remember what they felt and saw in the patient, and they’re doing that because they never had a conversation. This is really important. It affects everyone in the world — literally. That’s what motivates people to do this.”\n\nJoin Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes.

(In making this offering we are not endorsing any volume or exercise program. It's just a way to show you the wide range of resources available to you. Winners are announced at the end of each chat.)\n\nNow on to the chat!\n\nBoth my significant other and I have successfully lost significant weight before we met. But together we're having problems. Mostly it's different approaches. In the past, he used a low-carb approach. I've used a calorie-counting approach and allowed myself to eat lots of carbs as long as they fit in my calorie allowance -- as a matter of fact I cut meat to let the carbs fit. Now that we're combining meals, we've got the worst of both possible worlds -- he's eating more carbs and I'm eating more meat and we're both gaining weight. Any suggestions on how we can make this work?\n\nSally Squires: Yep. Sure do, Harrisonburg. You want to help him reach for lean cuts of meat, poultry and fish. You want him to help you reach for healthy types of complex carbs. So think beans, whole grains (wild and brown rice, whole-wheat couscous, whole-wheat bread, crackers and cereals) and of course, plenty of fruit and vegetables.\n\nSoups, stews and salads may be just the thing for both of you. They're high volume which will help you both feel fuller on fewer calories. And you can have small amounts of meat, poultry or fish in all of them. Portion sizes -- and counting some calories -- will also likely be quite wise for both of you. Plus, find ways to be active together.\n\nI loved hearing the anecdote from one of the couples in today's column: they lost weight together -- and sometimes fell off the wagon together -- but they also got back on...together!\n\nTrying for baby No. 2: Hi Sally,\n\nI've submitted this question a couple of times now and I hope you'll be able to get to it today. My husband and I have a 2-year-old and would like to have a second child soon. We're in our mid-30s and don't want to wait much longer to have another child. My problem is that I haven't menstruated since before getting pregnant with our son. I had thought this was because I am still nursing our toddler, although we're down to a morning and evening nursing session.\n\nBoth my OB/GYN and a lactation consultant I know have told me that my amenorrhea is more likely due to my weight (too thin?) than to the nursing. I'm about 5-foot-3 and weigh around 110 pounds. My body fat is about 17 percent. I exercise four to six times a week and consider myself fit and healthy, but not overly thin. I've been told that putting on up to 10 pounds will help solve my problem. My question is, how do I do this in a healthy way? Eating pizza and cheeseburgers every day doesn't seem like the right way to do it. Any advice for how to add some pounds without sacrificing my fitness and health?\n\nSally Squires: We get a lot of questions, as you can probably imagine. But I don't recall seeing this one before, so thanks very much for being persistent and re-submitting.\n\nYou're definitely at a healthy weight. Since this amenorrhea has lasted a while, it might be wise to get a second opinion. Low progesterone levels -- and other things -- can sometimes account for problems with ovulation.\n\nAs for putting on pounds -- you're right, eating extra helpings of high fat food won't cut it. So you want to have healthy stuff: think nuts and dried fruit. Or extra servings of anything that is wholesome and filled with good nutrition. So that could be extra yogurt, extra milk, extra cheese as well. You get the idea. And in terms of numbers, about an extra 100 calories per day will add about 10 pounds in a year. So that gives you a frame of reference. Good luck and please let us know how it goes. Thanks!\n\nBerwy Heights, Md.: I have a co-worker who recently has read an article about adding a teaspoon of olive oil between meals to curb your appetite and increase weight loss. It seems faddish to me. Thoughts?\n\nSally Squires: You'd have to really like that olive oil, wouldn't you? And also be certain that you're only consuming one teaspoon, which has about 40 calories. I suspect that this may have originated from the recently published Shangri-La Diet. Hope that helps.\n\nAtlanta: Really great idea to ban trans fats in restaurants. Some of the oil they use should not be consumed by any human being. Zero trans fats should really be zero, unlike to current unseemly law that allows food manufactures to label something zero trans fats when it really have 1/2 gram per serving or less of trans fats!\n\nSally Squires: Okay, so I'm keeping a count. That's one vote for the NYC Health Department's proposal to ban trans fat in restaurants. Thanks Atlanta!\n\nAlbuquerque, N.M.: I've been thinking about buying a pair of walking poles. Since they are a fairly expensive investment, I wonder if you know if they work as well as they claim. Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nSally Squires: There are so many great walking shoes available these days that I suspect you can find a good pair without breaking your budget. Biggest thing is to look for shoes after you have been walking for a while, since feet tend to swell. Also consider some pairs of comfortable socks. And be sure to go somewhere that will measure your feet so that you get a good fit. Also, there are plenty of orthotics to help if you need some extra cushioning.\n\nI don't know if you have a Nordstrom's near you--and I have no connection to the store -- but they will take shoes back without any questions asked. Other good shoe store suggestions out there for this LPCer who wants to let his/her feet do the walking?\n\nArlington, Va.: Sally please help! Do you know anything about prednisone/steroids? I was on it for a month, started with a high dose and went down each week. While on it, I gained about 7 pounds. I believe it is mostly water weight as it came on overnight and I was careful to watch what I ate. So the problem is, I have been off the prednisone for three weeks now and although I increased my exercise (I have always been active) and closely monitor what I eat (food log/Weight Watchers) I have still not lost an ounce. I am so frustrated and really don't know what else to do.\n\nSally Squires: This is a very common side-effect of prednisone and steroids, Arlington. So stay the course. Things should go back to normal. But it might also be worth it to give your doctor a call to let her/him know that this weight is lingering. My understanding is that it can take a while. But you can use that time to continue to pursue your healthy habits. Let us know how it goes. Hang in there!\n\nArlington, Va.: In regards to working together with your significant other to lose weight, I find that it's such great motivation. If I'm sitting on the couch watching TV and eating a snack, and I see that my boyfriend is going to go for a run, how lazy do I feel if I see him going and I'm just sitting there! I make it a point to cook healthy and he'll eat whatever so he doesn't really notice on the food side of things. All in all it works really well for us!\n\nOn a side note, one of the easiest meals to make for the two of us when we are in a rush: semi-cook two links of hot turkey Italian sausage with an onion, then add a can of Italian style diced tomatoes and a can of white cannelini beans (drained and rinsed), and either frozen baby broccoli buds or spinach to the pan with some garlic powder, hot pepper flakes, Italian seasoning, and whatever else we have on hand. It takes absolutely no time to cook and if we are craving and extra oomph to our dinner, we'll put it on a whole wheat warmed pita.\n\nJust wanted to share, hope your enjoying the warm weather!\n\nSally Squires: Yum. I'm getting hungry. Do you cater? Just kidding...And what you've just described so well is the \"ripple effect.\" That's when one partner does something and the other partner is motivated to try it too. Works well, don't you think? Thanks for weighing in.\n\nChicago: Love your columns, Sally -- thanks for all the great recipes and tips! Today's was very time-appropriate as I've been discussing getting healthy as a couple with my boyfriend. I've recently joined Weight Watchers in the hopes of shedding about 13 pounds and he wants to get in shape. However, he wants to turn it into a competition rather than a team thing! My instincts say it won't work, but I'm wondering if anyone else out there has had success with a competitive significant other? I'm thinking that slow and steady is going to see me to my goal, but I'd like to work with my boyfriend as a team toward our goals without the element of competition. Does anyone out there have any thoughts on a compromise?\n\nSally Squires: I've never been a big fan of competition in weight loss, Chicago. It just didn't feel right. But...when I reported on competition in recent years, I was surprised to find that it can work pretty well -- with some key ground rules.\n\nSince men and women lose weight at different rates -- sorry, gals, it's sad but true that men lose faster than we do! Life IS unfair -- you definitely want to focus on healthy habits. Or workouts. Or if you must, percentage of weight lost. That's the only fair way to even the playing field.\n\nYou might also set up something like this: each week you put a buck in a pot. You each agree to add some healthy habits. Maybe it's eating the recommended amount of fruit and veggies. Maybe it's going for a pre-specified walk. You get the idea. If you both meet the goals, you split the pot. If you don't, the one who does, gets it. If neither of you fulfills the contract, the money stays put. Or make up your own rules. You get the idea. Good luck. Hope you'll let us know how it goes. Thanks!\n\nWoodbridge, Va.: Sally, my husband, oldest son and I belong to a gym but my youngest son is too old for the daycare and not old enough to join. What are some suggestions that we can keep the younger one involved in physical activity?\n\nSally Squires: You might want to check out the LPC Family Challenge -- archived on our Web site -- where you can learn about a bunch of local parks in the area that would be great for all of you.\n\nTrips to the playground are another option. You and your husband can take turns walking the perimeter while the other watches your son.\n\nPools can offer great activity for everybody. And you might get him started on tossing a ball. We used to play balloon ball indoors which was good for hand-eye coordination -- and working up a little sweat.\n\nThat's just for starters. Bikes would be another way to get activity for everybody. Other thoughts out there?\n\nCarrollton, Tex.: My husband is on a low-carb diet and I'm on a balanced diet. I offer him what I am having, if he doesn't want that, he fixes his own meal. I don't want to be tempted by what he is having. I would like to be on the same diet, one that we could live with long term, but he thinks that it is too difficult to track what he is eating. He isn't losing weight very well and is getting frustrated. I think tracking what you eat is key to success. I have lost 55 pounds in 10 months. It has been slow and some weeks I have trouble staying strictly on plan. When I deviate, I just get back on plan and persevere. I feel so much better and am enjoying a wonderful Toning class at the local rec center three mornings a week and walking about three mornings a week. At 55, I feel younger than I have in years!\n\nSally Squires: Looks like the ripple effect hasn't yet affected your husband, Texas. But stay the course. Those 55 pounds speak much louder than words. And you might keep encouraging him with helpings of healthy things that you can both enjoy: salmon or other fish; berries (even Atkins includes those in later phases); plenty of veggies. Good luck and congratulations on what you've accomplished. Well done!\n\nStaten Island, N.Y.: Hi Sally,\n\nAs a resident of NYC, I can tell you first hand how badly we are losing the fight for a healthy weight and life style. It is disheartening to see school children, just off the bus or train, pop into a fast food restaurant for a 1,200 calorie after-school \"snack.\" Too often, their dinners will be more of the same. No wonder the city councilman from inner city neighborhoods are tempted to support this proposal. It is well intentioned, but forbidding foods rarely if ever works. Indeed for teenagers, it increases its attractiveness. We would be better served if we put our money and energy into education, similar to the anti-smoking ads so often seen on NYC TV stations. We need to teach children and adults to make better choices, not be the food patrol.\n\nSally Squires: You make some good points. It will take a concerted effort on many fronts to change things. So if I read you correctly, that's one vote for the proposed measure to ban trans fat and one against. Thanks for weighing in.\n\nClinton, Md.: Are baked potatoes high in calories?\n\nSally Squires: Not really -- unless you slather it with butter or sour cream. A potato that is two inches by about 5 inches has 145 calories. That includes three grams of protein, by the way, and a pretty good slug of vitamin C.\n\nChicago: I have never technically been overweight, but joined Weight Watchers in April to lose about 20 pounds. When my husband (who was slightly overweight) saw the results, he decided to follow the program himself. It took no prodding on my part -- a perfect case for leading by example! He has also lost about 20 pounds and several pants sizes.\n\nAlso, count me as a NO for the trans fat ban. I think it's a ridiculous Band-Aid measure targeting one substance that is only partially responsible, if at all, for the obesity crisis.\n\nSally Squires: Perfect example of the ripple effect! Together, you are 40 pounds lighter. Very impressive. And the tally is now two votes to one for that trans fat proposal in NYC. Thanks for weighing in.\n\nSan Diego: If fast food restaurants really wanted to improve their image, they would eliminate the trans fat in their food willingly, without waiting for local health departments to pass ordinances. After all, I can purchase fries, chicken nuggets, etc., from the grocery store that have no trans fat. I stopped taking my kids out for fast food months ago after explaining that trans fat is poison (language that a 6-year-old can understand) and they don't miss it at all.\n\nSally Squires: Okay, that evens the votes. Thanks for weighing in San Diego.\n\nArlington, Va.: Sally, I think you answered a question about poles with an answer about shoes. I think he's talking about walking sticks.\n\nSally Squires: Yep. You're (sadly) correct. Don't know how my eyes read walking shoes instead of walking stick. But there it is. As for the sticks, I better ask here which kind this LPCer means. If it's the traditional kind, you can also find them at various prices. (My husband and his family swear by these.) If it's the kind that look like ski poles without the skis, they are a little pricier, but they will give you some upper body workouts while you walk. I see a number of people using them in my neighborhood. I've tried them once -- and they seemed fine -- just weren't my cup of tea. But they're kind of hard to use while walking the dog!\n\nMoonbat, Richmond, Va.: Recommendations on lowering cholesterol through diet? Especially quick and easy breakfasts and lunches on the run?\n\nSally Squires: You bet! Start with oatmeal, which can be made the night before, put into a container and popped in the microwave wherever you are going. (Or put in a thermos to keep hot.) But that's just for starters. David Jenkins at the University of Toronto has developed a diet plan that contains cholesterol-lowering foods. Paul Williams, our producer, has found a link to a Lean Plate Club column on this very topic. I'll post. It should give you a lot to munch on! Enjoy.\n\nwashingtonpost.com: Portfolio Diet: Tough to Stay Invested In (Post, March 21, 2006)\n\nSally Squires: Here you go!\n\nNew Orleans: My (now ex-) wife and I traveled frequently on business, each often going in different directions on the globe. On one of her extended trips, I suggested we shed some pounds, and she agreed.\n\nSince we were both in locales of poor or expensive communications, we didn't discuss the issue at all. A few months later, we met again at her project. I had lost 40 pounds, she had not lost any. That was the beginning of the end. Rather than a congratulations, I was encouraged to undo my success.\n\nLessons learned: communicate often if you must diet at a distance; be supportive of a spouse's success, even if you are not as successful.\n\nSally Squires: Congratulations on those 40 pounds, but very sorry about the end of your marriage. Thanks much for chiming in.\n\nNay to the ban: I would have to say nay to the ban of trans fats. There should be a limit to the amount of legislating concerning personal choices -- especially where food is concerned. Of what nutritional value is candy corn? I say the restaurants should have the nutritional value of their food available but I don't care to see it on the menu. Sometimes you just want to throw caution to the wind and have a nice meal with butter and gravy. If it is staring you in the face you might not enjoy it and will feel guilty for eating it.\n\nSally Squires: All good points. We're now running 3 to 2 against the ban. But please double-check my math...Thanks!\n\nWorking at it in Arlington: My significant other is very dedicated to fitness and exercising, and has been his whole life. Me, not so much. We're both in our later 20s and while I'm not in bad shape (5-foot-4, 140 pounds, fairly strong), being healthy is an important issue for our relationship. I've recognized that committing to fitness is good for us, and it's good for me. What's really worked for us -- really brisk walks outside four or five times a week, for 35-45 minutes. I also found a weight routine that we can both do together two or three times a week. We eat healthy together -- lots of veggies and healthy meals. It's really helped me stay on course to have a motivator and partner. He's found that walking works him very differently than running and it's refreshing. Most men don't strength train their lower body so that has been good for him too. Sometimes it's frustrating that he's so in shape and any activity is easy for him, but he's willing to be my partner and do things at my level, while giving me a little push to do more. It's worked. I feel better than ever and really look forward to our time working out together. I would recommend to anybody that's struggling to find something you can do together and both enjoy, set up a schedule and stick to it.\n\nSally Squires: Couldn't have said it better myself, Arlington. Keep up the great regimen. Thanks for being an inspiration!\n\n\"Healthy\" Competition: A group of us at work decided we all could use to lose a few pounds. We did our first weigh-in on a Monday and every Monday after that for eight weeks. For each pound you lost you put in 50 cents. For each pound you gained you put in a dollar. The person who lost the most weight at the end got the pot. It was very motivating and the competition really helped. Some people did try to sabotage the others by bringing in treats though...\n\nSally Squires: Oh, that's kind of nasty, isn't it?\n\nBut the idea of working together as an office is quite motivating. And let's face it, many of us spend more hours -- or at least equal hours -- at work as we do at home. Thanks for weighing in.\n\nDresher, Pa.: Looking for good-tasting, low-salt dinner recipes due to diet restrictions. Can you help?\n\nSally Squires: You've come to the right place, Dresher. We'll post a link in a minute to the online cookbook by the American Heart Association. The AHA also publishes \"Low-Salt Cookbook: A Complete Guide to Reducing Sodium and Fat in Your Diet.\" It has plenty of low-sodium recipes.\n\nAlso, check out Dean Ornish's cookbooks. They're all low in sodium.\n\nAnd you don't want to miss the DASH Diet -- an example of your tax dollars at work. DASH has been clinically proven to lower blood pressure with diet and exercise. We'll put up links in just a minute to that too.\n\nSally Squires: Here's one link for the Lean Plate Club member looking for help with blood pressure lowering.\n\nGreek Yogurt Convert: Hey Lean Platers,\n\nI have discovered the awesomeness of Greek strained yogurt. If you like sour cream, try subbing fat-free Greek yogurt (Total makes a good brand that is on sale at Whole Foods). I made a curry beef stew and added cilantro and Greek yogurt and it was delish. It would be a great tangy topping for baked potatoes or fajitas. It's super low calorie too!\n\nSally Squires: I am a huge fan of that yogurt too. In fact, I've got some in my lunch today, which I hope to eat with fresh raspberries and a few slivered almonds. Yum!\n\nTotal yogurt can be a bit pricey, however. So Trader Joe's now has its own brand of Greek yogurt. To my taste buds, it's not quite as good, but it's a whole lot cheaper and would certainly work in cooking. It comes in both full fat and nonfat versions.\n\nAnybody else try this new product out there? We'd love to hear what you think.\n\nSally Squires: Here are the DASH recipes from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute for lowering blood pressure. Enjoy!\n\nBethesda, Md.: Do you have any suggestions for safe, quick weight loss? I overindulged in the last 10 days, and have put on 2-3 pounds.\n\nSally Squires: Nope. Sorry. No quick fixes.\n\nBut...if you just over-indulged in the last 10 days, most of that weight is water retention. Go back to healthy habits. Drink plenty of fluids. Start moving more and the weight will drop off again. Good luck.\n\nCharlotte, N.C.: My wife (and business partner) and I use a diet tracking software to record our food and exercise every day. Doing this together has been a big plus - when one of is is feeling a little lax, the other provides a nudge.\n\nJust paying attention to diet quantities and quality, using the treadmill, and walking the dog, has us losing a pound and a half a week for the past four months.\n\nSally Squires: That's a great use of technology together. Bet your dog is loving these new habits too, right? Thanks for weighing in.\n\nOklahoma: I changed my eating habits in May of this year. My husband soon joined me when he was ready. We have lost a total of 100 pounds together. I love to cook and I am enjoying the challenge of coming up with new ideas and making some of our old favorites healthy. He helped by setting up a spreadsheet and data base for me. The data base consists of all the foods and ingredients we use and I can add new ones. I just have to copy and paste the food into the spreadsheet, input the amount and it calculates the fat, kcal, sodium, etc. I always hated to write down what I ate and calculate the calories. This has helped me stay focused and not get lazy. We also own a good digital scale. We are really enjoying the new lifestyle and are now starting a good exercise program. Thanks for the chat!\n\nSally Squires: You're quite welcome and thank you -- and your husband -- for the wonderful inspiration!\n\nWashington D.C.: Hi Sally and LPCers: Today's LPC column raises an issue that is the opposite of the challenge in my house: my husband Jack Sprat has difficulty maintaining a healthy weight, whereas I have lost 45 pounds and intend to keep it off permanently. I'm trying to figure out ways to increase his calories without necessarily increasing mine. But how much grated cheese and chopped nuts can you sprinkle over a dinner plate?\n\nHis problem seems to be a complete lack of awareness of hunger, even when he hasn't eaten. So it's hard to motivate him with tempting snacks. His doctor is not worried about him, so maybe I should just leave him be. Thoughts?\n\nSally Squires: You've answered your own question. If he's in good health -- and his doctor is not concerned about his weight -- and your husband is happy with his weight, then let it go. By the way, congratulations on your very impressive 45 pound loss. That's wonderful.\n\nPittsburgh: I have a 4-year-old who goes through phases when she only eats bread and lollipops. At least the bread is whole wheat. We have lots of healthy food in our house and very little \"junk food,\" but the odd birthday party contributes to a small candy jar. She used to eat spinach leaves dipped in raspberry vinaigrette dressing. I've been having problems getting her to eat other types of fresh greens. But, since there's no more bagged greens for us, we got a salad spinner. And, she looooves it. She made salad for the whole family and pretended to be my little bunny last night while eating hers. I guess we found her new toy.\n\nSally Squires: Sounds like it! (And thank goodness your family -- and many others -- dodged the recent spinach bullet.) Your message underscores how kids go through eating phases, both good and bad. But it sounds like you already have that figured out. Thanks for weighing in.\n\nGaithersburg, Md.: My fiance and I are dieting together. We are reading labels, trying to eat lower calorie food, and joined a gym with a pool. We try to exercise most days. We are encouraging each other to stay on track and the pounds are coming off.\n\nAlso, I think the idea of having every restaurant post their caloric info. is wonderful. I think the government is overstepping the bounds by requiring a low trans fat menu.\n\nSally Squires: Okay, so by my count that four against the trans fat proposal, two for it. (And congratulations to you and your fiance on getting married and the good habits! That's a great way to start a new life together.)\n\nWinona, Minn.: My question is about salt? How much is too much? Sodium is listed on almost all packaged foods and it looks like so much. Example: 115 mg in a honey almond flax Kashi bar...it is 5 percent of your daily allowance, but it seems like a lot. Also, is there a minimum amount of salt a person needs? Can you go totally salt free or would you get sick? Thanks Sally.\n\nSally Squires: Estimates are that 80 percent of the sodium consumed in the U.S. comes from processed and restaurant food. So even if you take the salt shaker off the table, odds are that you're getting more than enough sodium daily.\n\nEven the new lower sodium soups by Campbell's and Progresso have about 400 milligrams per serving (and more.) Since recommendations are to eat 2400 milligrams or less (for those 50 and younger) just 1,500 milligrams or less per day for those 50 and older, plus African-Americans and people who already have blood pressure issues, you can see that it's possible to reach those levels faster than you can shake a salt shaker. (Sorry. I couldn't resist.)\n\nBottom line: low sodium -- except in the case of some medical problems -- is not likely to be a problem. One less thing to worry about!\n\nWashington, D.C.: This is for \"Trying for No. 2,\" who is having problems conceiving and was told that gaining 10 pounds might help. I am 5-foot-3 and probably about 115 pounds and also still occasionally breastfeeding my first child. I wanted her to know that I didn't start ovulating until I stopped breastfeeding almost completely. She might want to consider that instead of gaining 10 pounds.\n\nSally Squires: Yes. If she is still breastfeeding, that could indeed play a role. Thanks for weighing in.\n\nReston, Va.: I am confused about the difference between body fat and BMI. If I have a good BMI but am close to the \"overweight\" category for body fat, what does that exactly mean? Thanks!\n\nSally Squires: It does get confusing, doesn't it? Percentage of body tells you roughly how much your of what you're carrying around every day is, well, fat.\n\nBody mass index uses a mathematical equation that takes into account your height and weight and delivers a number.\n\nWe'll post a link in a minute to an online BMI calculator.\n\nIn the meantime, here are the BMI ranges to pay attention to:\n\nObesity: BMI of 30 or greater\n\nRemember that BMI is a screening tool. It gives you one data point. And there is some suggestion that there are ethnic and racial differences in BMI. We'll post a link for you to read more. Plus BMI doesn't take into account percentage of body fat. So some elite athletes may look overweight, when they're not. But most of us mere mortals don't fall into that category.\n\nSally Squires: Here's the link to calculate your BMI -- another example of your tax dollars at work!\n\nAlexandria, Va.: I have been on a plateau for two months! I've lost 40 pounds so far but I have a lot more to lose. I didn't expect such a long plateau so early. I have tried just about everything I can think of and have been recommended. I am eating different foods, more lean proteins, less sugar, I'm eating a lot of fiber, I changed up my exercises. What else is there? I'm afraid tonight's weigh-in will be more of the same. I'm not to the point of giving up; I know it could take two years to loose the weight the right way. But it is very depressing to hate getting on the scale when I'm working so hard.\n\nSally Squires: It is discouraging, isn't Alexandria? But as you already know, it is not uncommon. So what can you do? Make sure that you are not experiencing any calorie creep. So you might just re-double your efforts at weighing and measuring everything that passes your lips. At least for a few days or a week.\n\nTry to get more active throughout the day. So even if you just get up and walk around the office for five minutes of every hour, you'll add some calorie burning. Do you wear a pedometer? It can sometimes be a motivator and reminder to move more. If you're not doing weigh training, that's something else to add.\n\nAnd then if you can view this plateau as a way to hone your healthy habits, you will be ready for the day when you have reached your goal and you will be striving to maintain your healthy weight. The more practice you have at that --which is essentially what you are doing right now -- the better. So in a way, you're ahead of the curve, even if it doesn't seem like that right now!\n\nHang in there. Please let us know how it goes.\n\nwashingtonpost.com: One Number Doesn't Fit All (Post, July 5, 2005)\n\nSally Squires: Here's the other link for the Lean Plate Club column on ethnic and racial differences in BMI.\n\nCouples WW: I joined Weight Watchers and told my boyfriend; a week later he said he'd do it with me. We turned it into a game/contest of who could stay within their points. It would have been much harder if he hadn't done it too, because we stopped ordering pizza and Chinese, filled the house with healthier choices and got excited when we found new things that were good and low points. The other great thing about it is that when you're slowly (healthily)losing weight, though your clothes fit a little differently and you see the scale numbers go down, it's really hard to look at yourself and see a big difference sometimes, but easier to see in other people, so we'd motivate each other that way. We also didn't pick on each other if one of us went overboard one day, didn't matter, just get back on track the next.\n\nWe still sort figure out maintenance points, still get excited about low point/healthy finds (which there are more and more every day!) and now are really into motivating each other to exercise. Usually one or the other of us is in the mood to go to the gym so we motivate the other one, and if we're both not, then we take that as a sign that we should take a break that day.\n\nHaving someone (significant other, friend, etc.) working on weight loss with you, I think makes SUCH a big difference because you can motivate each other when one is losing some! I'm so excited you wrote about this, because in our case I think having each other made all of the difference.\n\nSally Squires: Hear, hear! Thanks very much for weighing in.\n\nArlington, Va.: I need help with the other side of the couples equation -- one I'm sure many women especially are familiar with. I'm so happy in my relationship, and content with my boyfriend's positive attitude toward me and my physical appearance (regardless of what size I am!) that I've been overeating. And eating poorly. And matching him bite for bite when we're together. How do I motivate myself now? I don't WANT to gain weight, I know this mentally, but every time it comes time to eat/sleep in instead of exercising, I just kind of let myself do as I please... I don't know what to do, as I love this positive-self esteem I've gotten from him, but at the same time don't want to reap negative body benefits...thanks in advance!\n\nSally Squires: Sounds like you've found a great guy, Arlington. One who is worth his weight in gold. But you want to be around for him, don't you? And you want to be able to enjoy doing lots of things with him, don't you? As you already know well, putting on lots of weight reduces your odds of being around for him.\n\nSo...you start where everybody starts. One step at a time. One small change that you know you can do. Maybe it's eating an extra serving of veggies or fruit while he has something more fattening. Maybe it's walking with him. Maybe it's biking with him. Maybe it's getting another exercise partner to get you motivated. Whatever it is, you want to eat smart and move more, one meal at a time. Let us know how it goes.\n\nLancaster, Pa.: In my attempts to lose those pesky 10 pounds, I'm trying to cut more bread from my diet. I bring a sandwich to work each day. Would exchanging my bread for a tortilla wrap help cut down on what contributes to weight gain? Thanks very much.\n\nSally Squires: It's not the bread -- or the tortilla wrap -- that does it Lancaster. It's the total calories in versus total calories out. It's how much you move during the day. It's the total package -- not any one food. So look at the big picture, not at any one food. And let us know how it goes. Good luck with your efforts.\n\nLynchburg, Va.: I began a serious lifestyle change around two years ago to lose weight and improve my physical fitness, and have been relatively successful at it. I prepared regular meals, making sure that there were plenty of healthy items on the menu, and just ate less or none of certain foods that my husband still enjoyed eating -- primarily white starches, high-fat items and desserts.\n\nAfter about one year into my \"new lifestyle,\" my husband, who was more than a little out of shape himself, began to copy my diet and fitness activities. As a couple, we switched completely from white to whole-wheat breads, cut out high-fat foods and empty starches, switched to more salads with minimal or low-fat dressings and so forth. He also began a joining me in my daily walks. This should have been good news. My husband, however, is a very competitive person, and things quickly deteriorated into a \"contest.\" I was content to walk a certain route daily, slowing trying to increase my speed, but not worrying about it. He, on the other hand, had to keep track of the time of every quarter mile, and constantly worked to improve the time, an effort I found onerous. The end result is that we no longer exercise together. He does his thing and I do mine, but we have lost the special togetherness of walking with each other.\n\nWe still continue to eat healthily and to share healthy meals together, but even that has moved into the contest realm (of the \"I'm eating less than you are\" variety -- it's very subtle, but it's there). My husband is the sweetest man in the world, but when there's a challenge presented, he becomes a competitive monster. My only recourse has been to concentrate solely on my own fitness goals and distance myself from his as much as possible. And yes, a little envy has crept into my feelings, because he has been able to lose weight so much more easily than I. I'm glad my husband has lost weight and improved his fitness, but it has come at a very high price, I think, in terms of our relationship.\n\nSally Squires: It sounds like it has indeed, Lynchburg. Any chance that you can address these issues directly with your husband? Maybe even show him the message that you posted if you feel comfortable doing that? In the meantime, continued success with your habits -- and in motivating your husband's changes. Please let us know how it goes.\n\nSally Squires: Thanks to all for a wonderful and wide-ranging chat. You all make my job very easy.\n\nWinner today are: New Orleans; Lynchburg; Oklahoma; San Diego and Charlotte and Working at it in Arlington. If Dresher will contact me after that chat, I'll pass along another tip. Winners: please e-mail me at leanplateclub@washpost.com and please put winner in the subject line.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00011-of-00064--275", "original_text": "Bob Knight and Mike Krzyzewski, the two winningest D1 men's college coaches, shared an embrace on Tuesday night.\n\nNEW YORK -- Mike Krzyzewski became the winningest coach in the history of men's major college basketball at 9:36 p.m. on Tuesday, when his Duke Blue Devils defeated Michigan State, 74-69, at Madison Square Garden. The achievement, however, was not sealed until a minute later, when Krzyzewski walked to the broadcast table and shared a teary embrace with the man whom he had just surpassed, Bob Knight, who had analyzed the game for ESPN. \"I know a lot of people don't tell you this, Coach,\" Krzyzewski said. \"But I love you.\"\n\nAs Krzyzewski spoke, Knight had his face buried in Krzyzewski's suit jacket. Then he pulled back, smiled and said, \"Boy, you've done pretty good for a kid who couldn't shoot.\" Knight laughed and slapped Krzyzewski hard on the shoulder. \"I think that meant he loved me, too,\" Krzyzewski said later. \"I'm going to take it as that.\"\n\nIt has been a long, winding, tumultuous, heartfelt and sometimes heartbreaking ride that brought Mike Krzyzewski and Bob Knight to that embrace. But there they were, sharing the happy coincidence that allowed them both to be present for this moment in history. The record now shows that Krzyzewski has 903 career wins to Knight's 902, but their relationship cannot be defined by mere numbers. It only took five decades, but these two men finally speak each other's language, even if those closest to them don't.\n\n\"Their relationship fascinates me. It kind of defies description,\" Krzyzewski's wife, Mickie, said Tuesday night. \"It's sort of unbelievable that they're a coach and player who together have 1,800 wins. But the relationship between Coach Knight and Mike, which healed years ago, is much more unique to me than the fact that they share this honor.\"\n\nGrant Hill: A former player talks Coach K's impact on and off the court\n\nIt's amazing enough that a man would surpass his former college coach to break the NCAA's most significant coaching record. What's even more amazing is that the university which brought them together wasn't a basketball factory like Kansas, Kentucky or UCLA. It wasn't even Ohio State, where Knight was a reserve guard on the 1960 NCAA championship team. Rather, it was the United States Military Academy at West Point, a place known more for churning out generals and presidents than Hall of Fame basketball coaches.\n\nKnight was just 25 years old when he walked into Bill and Emily Krzyzewski's living room in the spring of 1965 to recruit their son, who led Chicago's Catholic League in scoring while playing point guard for Weber High School. (Krzyzewski's dad used the surname Kross because he believed it would be easier for him to find work.) Mike's parents were enticed by the idea that their son could attend such a prestigious university, but to his parents' consternation Mike told Knight he wasn't interested. He hoped that he could play for a Midwestern college with a better hoops program such as Creighton, Detroit, maybe even a school in the Big Ten. When those offers never came, his parents' prodding -- their \"ethnic pressure,\" as Krzyzewski calls it -- eventually changed the boy's mind.\n\nAs Army's point guard, Krzyzewski earned his minutes by accepting Knight's abuse and heeding his strict instructions never to shoot. During his three years on the varsity, Krzyzewski never averaged more than seven points per game, but he led the Black Knights to two appearances in the NIT. That included a trip to the semifinal his senior year, when Army lost to Boston College in Madison Square Garden.\n\nLater that night, Krzyzewski's father suffered a massive brain hemorrhage. He was dead before Mike could get home. Knight dropped everything, followed his point guard to Chicago and stayed at the Krzyzewskis' house for three days. Mike never forgot the kindness Knight showed his mother that week as he consoled her while the two of them sat in the family kitchen. \"That's when I saw Coach Knight start to emerge as a father figure to Mike,\" Mickie said.\n\nFollowing his five-year stint in the Army, Krzyzewski joined Knight's staff at Indiana as a graduate assistant. The following year, Krzyzewski took over as head coach at his alma mater. The Knights had won just three games the previous season, but they won 20 and 19, respectively, during Krzyzewski's second and third seasons. From there, however, they backtracked, and in Krzyzewski's fifth year they finished with an overall record of 7-19.\n\nDuring the spring of 1980, Knight got a call from Tom Butters, the athletic director at Duke. Butters was looking to hire a basketball coach, and he wanted to float a few candidates. According to Gene Wojciechowski's forthcoming book, The Last Great Game, which tells the story of the epic 1992 regional final between Duke and Kentucky, Knight actually thought Krzyzewski was better suited for a place like Iowa State, where he wouldn't have to face so much pressure. Still, he told Butters the truth: Krzyzewski was a great defensive coach, and coming from West Point he would understand Duke's academic mission. That prompted Butters to interview Krzyzewski, and he eventually shocked the public by tapping the unknown cadet to be his coach.\n\nGallery: Classic photos of coach Mike Krzyzewski\n\nOver the next decade, Knight and Krzyzewski remained close as they circled each other from afar. As Krzyzewski built Duke into a winner -- surviving a combined 21-34 record his second and third seasons -- he often relied on his former coach's friendship and advice. On the eve of Duke's matchup with Louisville in the 1986 NCAA final, he asked Knight to speak to his team. When Duke lost, Knight called Krzyzewski every day for a week to make sure he was OK. The next year, their teams played each other for the first time, meeting in the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA tournament. Indiana won en route to capturing Knight's second title.\n\nFive more years passed before fate again brought their teams together. It happened at the 1992 Final Four. By that time, their career arcs had begun to diverge. In the five years since their teams last played, Knight had not returned to the Final Four. Krzyzewski, on the other hand, made five more trips, and in '91 he broke through to win his first NCAA championship. In the days leading up to the game, the two men's baser instincts -- pride, combativeness, insecurity, envy -- surfaced in subtle ways. Krzyzewski was deferential in his public remarks, but he downplayed the obvious storyline by pointing out that while Knight had had the most influence on him, he also benefited from relationships with other coaches. Krzyzewski could also become prickly when Knight's specter was invoked. During a news conference the day before Duke's second-round game against Iowa, a reporter asked him whether he had called Knight for advice on how to beat the Big Ten school. \"No,\" Krzyzewski snapped. \"Somewhere in my 17 years as a coach I've figured out how to scout an opponent.\"\n\nUnbeknown to Krzyzewski, Knight, who already had an unseemly tendency to feel threatened by his friends' successes, took offense. After the game, which Duke won 81-78, a slew of cameras predictably surrounded the two men as they approached for the postgame handshake. Krzyzewski stopped to share some words and perhaps a hug. Knight, however, stuck out his hand and blew right on by. Krzyzewski was visibly stunned.\n\nHe was even more surprised a short while later after Knight wrapped up his postgame news conference, stepped off the dais and came upon the Duke contingent waiting to speak. Knight congratulated the players on their win but said nothing to Krzyzewski. Later, a mutual friend handed Krzyzewski a note from Knight that essentially said, if a divorce is what you want, then a divorce is what you've got. As his players later conducted postgame interviews in Duke's locker room, Krzyzewski sat in a backroom with tears in his eyes and lamented to his assistants, \"There are days when life's not fair.\"\n\nThe incident led to a deep freeze between the two proud men that lasted almost a year. In December, when Krzyzewski was asked about his mentor, he replied, \"My relationship with Coach Knight is like my relationship with my wife. And I don't talk about my relationship with my wife.\" (The statement was unconvincing considering Krzyzewski frequently talked about his relationship with his wife.) \"I was mad because Mike was hurting, and I just knew the problem could be solved,\" Mickie said. \"This was a misunderstanding. It was people saying things that are being attributed to other people. It was very frustrating for me to see Mike in that kind of agony and miss Coach so much and not be able to do anything about it.\"\n\nFinally, in January of '93, Knight reached out. At first, Krzyzewski refused to take the call, but eventually the two men talked for over an hour. Knight never technically apologized -- saying he's sorry is not exactly the man's strong suit -- but Krzyzewski forgave him anyway and decided it was time to move on.\n\nFor the next few years they were friendly but not especially close, the scars from their Final Four rupture still raw. In the winter of 1995, Indiana and Duke played each other without incident at the Great Alaska Shootout. Krzyzewski assumed the two were still on good terms when they met again in Madison Square Garden during the championship game of the preseason NIT in 1996. Krzyzewski knew that Knight liked to come out on the court close to tipoff, so he went over to the Indiana bench and waited for him. The horn sounded to mark the end of warmups, but Knight had still not emerged. The player introductions began. Still no Knight. Finally, Knight walked out ... and ignored Krzyzewski while chatting amiably with legendary horse trainer D. Wayne Lukas.\n\nIndiana pasted Duke by 16 points. Afterward, Krzyzewski was more resigned than heartbroken. \"I'm almost glad it happened that way,\" he told author John Feinstein for his book, A March to Madness, a look inside the ACC. \"It lets me put a period on the end of the sentence. The end. You know, it's really kind of sad. He keeps turning friends away. I'm not the first or the last. I tried to do the right thing. I'm over it now. Five years ago, that would have hurt me. It doesn't hurt anymore.\"\n\nAs Knight and Krzyzewski went their separate ways, their careers did the same. After his team defeated Indiana in the '92 Final Four, Krzyzewski coached in three more championship games, winning his third title in 2001. Meanwhile, from 1995 to 2000, Knight's Indiana teams won a total of two NCAA tournament games. In September of 2000, Knight was fired by Indiana president Myles Brand for violating the zero tolerance policy Brand had put in place just four months before. Knight was humiliated and devastated, but Krzyzewski never called to console him.\n\nTheir friends and spouses weren't sure how to repair the breach, or even if they wanted to. \"I stayed out of it because I knew that the pain came from a real place,\" Mickie Krzyzewski said. \"That place was anger. Mike had to work through that before he could sincerely pick up the phone.\"\n\nThe moment to do so finally arrived in 2001. Krzyzewski had been voted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., and he needed to select a member of the Hall to present him for induction. Krzyzewski and Mickie bandied names for several days. Finally, Krzyzewski told his wife he had chosen Knight. \"I said, 'Coach Knight? Why?' And he said, 'He's the only one,'\" Mickie recalled. \"It was the perfect salve for that wound.\"\n\nKnight accepted the invitation. As Krzyzewski's three daughters took the stage that night to introduce him, Knight, whom Mickie once thought was \"the meanest man in the world\" while he coached her boyfriend at Army, walked off the stage, took Mickie by the hand and led her up the stairs so she could stand beside her husband. Knight's speech that night was eloquent and stirring. He told the audience that Krzyzewski was a much better player than he had given himself credit for. He said the only important thing Krzyzewski had learned from him was what not to do. And his voice quavered as he brought Krzyzewski to the stage by calling him \"the best coach that I've had a team play against.\" Krzyzewski climbed the stairs, shook hands with a few dignitaries, and then fell into his coach's arms and sobbed. It looked exactly like what it was: a father and son, previously estranged, reconciling in front of thousands of people.\n\nSince that day, their relationship has continued to evolve, as relationships do. They're still equal parts coach-player and father-son, but they're also fellow coaches, colleagues, best friends. They're older now, more comfortable in their own skin, less susceptible to the pettiness that almost severed them for good. When Krzyzewski praises Knight these days, there is no hint of equivocation. He has also gotten smarter about avoiding potential triggers. After Brand left Indiana to become president of the NCAA, he reached out to Krzyzewski and invited him to Brand's house to talk. Before saying yes, Krzyzewski called Knight to make sure it was OK with him. (It was.)\n\nNow, thanks to Tuesday night's events, they can enjoy one more bond, a remarkable moment when they switched places atop the NCAA's record book. Krzyzewski thanked the \"basketball gods\" for arranging for Knight to be there -- at Madison Square Garden, no less -- but the truth is, the gods have been arranging that moment for over 40 years. When it finally arrived, it didn't matter how turbulent or hurtful their journey had been. The only thing that mattered was where that journey had taken them, and where it takes them still.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nBob Knight and Mike Krzyzewski, the two winningest D1 men's college coaches, shared an embrace on Tuesday night.

(Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nEven as they hold the line in refusing to grant the president’s Supreme Court nominee a hearing before November, two dozen Republican senators either support or do not rule out allowing a vote to confirm Merrick Garland during the lame-duck session.\n\nAs the senators return to Washington today from a two-week recess, this is a scenario that many in the Capitol see as probable: If Hillary Clinton is elected president, she is virtually certain to nominate someone who is both more progressive and younger than President Obama’s pick to succeed Antonin Scalia. Even if they manage to hold their majority, it is a near mathematical certainty that Republicans will hold fewer Senate seats next year than they do now. So, to prevent Clinton from moving the court further leftward, Republicans could rush Garland through during the two months after the election and before the new Congress gets sworn in.\n\nGOP leaders, including Mitch McConnell, have publicly ruled out that they would do this. But some aides privately acknowledge such a gambit remains a possibility.\n\nOur reporters canvassed all 54 members of the Republican conference, asking everyone (either directly or through a spokesman) whether they support hearings, whether they’re willing to meet with Garland and whether they could support action in the lame-duck session.\n\nAs of this morning, 52 of the 54 GOP senators oppose a hearing for Garland, let alone an up-or-down vote. The only two who favor hearings are Susan Collins of Maine and Mark Kirk of Illinois.\n\nTwo other Republicans, who are up for reelection this year and possibly vulnerable to primary challenges, have changed their tune. Jerry Moran of Kansas told a Rotary Club the week before last that senators “have the responsibility to have a hearing.\" Then, on Friday night, he recanted after a deluge of calls and emails orchestrated by a constellation of right-wing groups. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska has reversed herself over the past few weeks. She went from saying “the nominee should get a hearing” to saying she “respects the decision” of Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley “not to hold hearings.”\n\nAt least 16 Republican senators say they plan to meet with Garland in their offices. But these ceremonial photo ops don’t really matter much.\n\nAsked if they would support a vote to confirm Garland during the lame-duck session if Clinton wins, three senators said yes: Collins, Kirk and Jeff Flake of Arizona.\n\nAn additional 20 senators declined to express an on-the-record position about whether they would support lame-duck action: John Barrasso (Wyo.), Bill Cassidy (La.), Thad Cochran (Miss.), Bob Corker (Tenn.), Tom Cotton (Ark.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Mike Enzi (Wyo.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Deb Fischer (Neb.), Jim Inhofe (Okla.), James Lankford (Okla.), John McCain (Ariz.), Mike Rounds (S.D.), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Jeff Sessions (Ala.), Dan Sullivan (Alaska), John Thune (S.D.), Pat Toomey (Pa.), David Vitter (La.) and Roger Wicker (Miss.).\n\nAnd Orrin Hatch of Utah, who has praised Garland in the past, has been all over the place on the lame-duck question. After floating the idea, he later said he misspoke. “I’ve never really been open to that,” he told Kelsey Snell. “I’m saying he’s a fine man, and I think it ought to be the next president who makes the choice.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nSomething like two-thirds of Americans want Congress to act on Garland, but most voters don’t care all that much. And conservatives are way more fired up about holding on to Scalia’s seat than liberals are about confirming Garland – a white male and former prosecutor who is more moderate than the other Democratic appointees on the D.C. Circuit. (If you missed it, two weeks ago I explored the enthusiasm gap from Wisconsin.)\n\nSenate Democrats continue trying to activate their base and keep Republican obstruction in the news. Elizabeth Warren will appear on a conference call for liberal activists later today. Obama will give a speech about the vacancy this Thursday at the University of Chicago Law School.\n\nSome prominent liberals want Obama to pull Garland’s nomination if a Democrat wins the White House to prevent Garland from being confirmed in a lame duck. But senior administration officials continue to be adamant that Obama will not withdraw Garland if Hillary wins, no matter how much pressure he faces from the left.\n\n-- Scoop: Rep.

(AFP/Getty Images)\n\n-- Deportations began in Europe. \"The European Union began sending back across the sea hundreds of people who, only days ago, braved the crossing to Greece aboard flimsy rubber rafts in search of a new life,\" our Griff Witte reports from Mytilene. \"Just after dawn on Lesbos, several bus-loads of men were led aboard two ferries under heavy police and military guard. The ferries, flying Turkish flags, steamed out of the port and turned east toward the rising sun along the Turkish coast. The deportations are the first of thousands expected under the E.U.’s plan to end the continent’s refugee crisis by shifting the burden onto neighboring Turkey. Human rights groups have condemned the strategy as a violation of basic rights. ... More deportations are expected to follow later in the week, with Europe hoping that images of people being sent back will create enough of a deterrent to halt the flow of new arrivals.\"\n\nEmergency personnel pass equipment across police tape to work on train tracks near the site of an Amtrak derailment.

(AP Photo/Dave Kolpack)\n\n-- Ted Cruz declared victory in North Dakota’s GOP convention, saying he won 18 of 25 unbound delegate slots. The selection of delegates came after the senator flew to Fargo and sent Carly Fiorina to schmooze for him. Ben Carson spoke for Trump. Technically, none of the delegates are required to support Cruz – or any other candidate, David Weigel explains: “While Cruz’s team identified 18 supporters among 25 ‘unbound’ delegates that North Dakota Republicans elected, nothing they said, and no list they appeared on, bound any delegates to a choice at July's convention. ... Several delegates indicated they were only ‘leaning toward Cruz,’ or simply opposed to Trump.” Cruz's success came in spite of the state's lone congressman, Kevin Cramer, endorsing Trump during the convention.\n\nA published report based on 11.5 million leaked records says associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin have moved as much as $2 billion through offshore accounts.

The state’s blue-collar demographics, along with party rules allowing independent voters to cast ballots in the primary, have been expected to work in his favor.” (Rep.

(Reuters/Kamil Krzaczynski)\n\n-- Cruz quietly launched his first attack ad against John Kasich over the weekend. His team sees Kasich as a potential spoiler in the Badger State. “The spot, which was first reported by CNN (and not released by the campaign), portrays the Ohio governor as being cozy with a corporation that received undeserved state tax breaks. The commercial arrived as the pro-Cruz Trusted Leadership PAC had just introduced an ad slamming Kasich for expanding Medicaid under President Obama's health-care law -- after hitting him days earlier with a spot accusing him of having a ‘liberal record.’” (Read Sean Sullivan’s story. Watch a recording of the ad.)\n\nTrump, for his part, accused Kasich of “siphoning away” more votes from him than Cruz. “He’s not taking Cruz’s votes. He’s taking my votes,\" the front-runner told reporters in Milwaukee, adding that he voiced displeasure about him during his meeting at the RNC last week. (Jose A.

(Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\n-- With dueling press releases, Clinton and Sanders battled over when an upcoming debate should take place. Clinton's campaign offered April 14 and 15 as possibilities, while Sanders’s team pushed April 10.\n\n-- To preempt Trump attacks, the Clinton campaign has begun aggressively emphasizing her STAMINA to reporters. “Clinton's aides, who are well into their preparations for a possible general-election matchup against Trump, have begun executing a strategy to counter Trump's pattern of personal insults by ‘going big’ on policy and substance - and also by being unshy about noting her penchant for marathon work days,” our Abby Phillip and Anne Gearan report. “Aides have described in detail, for instance, how Clinton responded to the Brussels terrorist attacks as Americans awakened to the devastating news. After arriving in Seattle at roughly 2 a.m. local time for campaign stops later in the day, Clinton was awake and preparing to place a series of phone calls to the major television networks by 5 a.m., when coverage of the attacks was well underway on the East Coast. … It irks supporters that Trump, who is also older than Clinton and has more grandchildren, could take shots at Clinton that hint at her age as a liability.”\n\nBernie Sanders looks at his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, in Detroit on March 8. (Reuters/Jim Young)\n\n-- Sanders would be in a much stronger position right now if he’d been willing to hit Clinton harder and keep a more aggressive campaign schedule last year.

They hope one day to be less, but the only way to get there is if they have an example of a country where people of different religions can live and work together and go to school together and make it work. We’ve been that example for them and they’re very nervous when they see us backsliding.”\n\nA spokesperson for Netanyahu emailed BuzzFeed: “Prime Minister Netanyahu is very careful to avoid even the appearance of preference among American presidential candidates. In his meeting with Senator Kaine and his colleagues, Prime Minister Netanyahu did not express any opinion about the candidates or any of their positions.”\n\n-- “Republicans on FEC suggest they may scrutinize mystery corporate donors,” by Matea Gold: “The three Republican appointees on the divided FEC have indicated political donors who give through private companies to shield identities can be sanctioned, signaling the agency may scrutinize ‘pop-up’ corporations giving large sums to super PACs … Democratic commissioners reacted with skepticism, saying GOP colleagues [previously] delayed and blocked examination of such cases … But Republican commissioner Lee Goodman, said that contributors seeking to mask themselves through a privately held company or LLC should think twice. ‘Six commissioners have now taken the position that closely held LLCs can violate the law under certain circumstances when they make contributions to super PACs,’ he said. ‘Now everyone should be on notice … ‘If you funnel money through an LLC entity for the purpose of making a political contribution and avoiding disclosure of yourself, that is an abuse of the LLC vehicle,’ Goodman added.”\n\nFayez Serraj, head of the U.N.-backed unity government, meets with his team in Tripoli last Thursday.

The tentative progress comes as the U.S. progresses with plans to launch intensified attacks against the Islamic State’s Libyan branch, which is the group’s strongest affiliate outside Iraq and Syria. Planners at U.S. Africa Command are now developing dozens of targets across Libya that [western] warplanes might strike. They range from the coastal city of Sirte, where the extremist group has established a refuge, to Ajdabiya, Sabratha and the militant stronghold of Derna.

(Jane Hahn for The Washington Post)\n\n-- “They were freed from Boko Haram’s rape camps. But their nightmare isn’t over,\" by Kevin Sieff: “Few could have imagined such an outcome two years ago, when 276 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram and the world responded with the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. While most of those schoolgirls are still missing, many assumed other kidnapped women would be warmly welcomed back. [Instead,] the military quietly deposited them in displacement camps or abandoned buildings, where they are monitored by armed men suspicious of their loyalties ... They are still labeled ‘Boko Haram wives.’ Authorities say there are good reasons for their wariness. Last year, 39 of 89 Boko Haram suicide bombings were carried out by women … 21 of these attackers were under 18, girls abducted and converted into assassins … No one knows exactly why some women captured and abused became killers, [whether] it was indoctrination or threats … Either way, reintegrating the displaced has become vastly more complicated for authorities. And for survivors trying to move on from a horrific chapter of their lives, there is new agony.”\n\nFOUR BUZZY STORIES ABOUT THE DONALD:\n\n-- From a 96-minute interview Trump gave Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, which ran on the front page of Sunday's newspaper: Trump said he would not pick an outsider like himself as a vice-presidential running mate, but rather, “somebody that can walk into the Senate and who’s been friendly with these guys for 25 years, and people for 25 years. And can get things done. So I would 95 percent see myself picking a political person as opposed to somebody from the outside.” Read the longer story here.

Which is how Trump’s scorched-earth strategy coalesced. To break out of the pack, he [decided] to be provocative, even outrageous. ‘If I were presidential, I’d be one of many people who are already out of the race,’ Trump said. And this formula worked better than anyone, including Trump, could have imagined … When he launched his campaign, Trump suspected it would fizzle and he’d eventually return to The Apprentice. But as weeks passed, he resisted calls to professionalize his campaign. Why bother, when [his approach] was working so well? But now the cracks are starting to show. ... ‘I’ve had good ratings from the time I was born, for whatever reason,’ he said. ‘It hasn’t just started.’ Now that his campaign seems more vulnerable, however, I can’t help but wonder if he wishes he could go back to a reality show where he can’t be fired.”\n\n-- Buzzfeed, “Meet Trump’s Hispanics,” by Adrian Carrasquillo: “Trump is toxic with most Latino voters. But even a low percentage of Latino voters would mean a couple million Hispanic supporters … Who are these people? … In interviews, [Latino] Trump supporters stressed their American roots. No one was just Puerto Rican or Mexican, and few used a hyphenated identity common in the Hispanic community. One said his family ‘has been in the country a couple hundred years’ and another when asked his ethnicity said his family was ‘from Texas, which used to be Mexico.’ Many of his Hispanic supporters say they weren’t offended because they don’t believe he was referring to them. ‘He didn’t insult all Mexicans by his comments,’ said Antonio Rios, a former Sanders supporter who flipped to Trump. ‘I’m open-minded enough to know what he meant.’ One thing they all have in common, though, is a thick skin.”\n\nTRUMP, ONCE AGAIN, DOMINATED THE SUNDAY SHOWS:\n\n-- Reince Priebus, appearing on all five Sunday shows, said Trump’s threats to abandon his GOP loyalty pledge “have consequences.” “When you make those kinds of comments, and you want people to fall in line for you, it makes it more difficult,” he told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, adding that Trump was “posturing” for the media. “We expect when candidates make commitments, that they keep them,” Priebus added in an interview on Fox News Sunday.\n\n-- Trump expressed regret for retweeting a disparaging picture of Heidi Cruz. “I could have done without the tweet,” he admitted on “Fox News Sunday.” The GOP front-runner refused to admit he made a mistake on his abortion comments in last week’s town hall, however. “As a hypothetical question, I would have rather answered it in a different manner,\" said Trump, adding that he has since corrected his stance. Trump also remained defiant regarding Corey Lewandowski, calling him a “good, honest man” after he was charged with battery for grabbing a female reporter’s arm. “The easier thing to do would have been [to fire him],” said Trump. “But I don’t want to ruin him. I don’t want to destroy him.”\n\n-- Trump hesitated when asked if abortion is murder.

The shrine-like back room is filled with photos and posters of the singer and movie star, young and thin, old and beefy.\n\nBut Sinatra himself, who died in 1998 at 82, is not in the framed newspaper page that draws a visitor's attention.\n\nIt shows the front of Piccolos in 1986, draped with a banner: \"It's All Right Frank Sinatra. We Love You! That Book Lies.\"\n\nThat book was Kitty Kelley's sensational best seller His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra.\n\nThe visitor at Piccolos is James Kaplan, author of yet another Sinatra book, Frank: The Voice (Doubleday, $35), to be released Tuesday.\n\nAt first, Kaplan quips, \"Maybe they should dust off that sign.\"\n\nThen he adds, \"I shouldn't say that. I wonder if I've written anything that will make people mad.\"\n\nIt's not as if Kaplan has ignored the Sinatra scandals: the incessant adultery and affairs, his palling around with gangsters, the fistfights or the fact that Dolly Sinatra, his mother, was not only a midwife but was arrested for performing abortions.\n\nBut after more than a dozen major biographies and scores of other Sinatra books and articles, Kaplan says he has something different to say about an uncomfortable, hyper-sensitive genius who turned his voice into The Voice.\n\nOver lunch at Piccolos, first stop on a Hoboken visit, Kaplan says that in the five years he worked on the book (reading the \"overwhelming\" material already written and conducting 150 interviews), he was often asked, \"What dirt did you dig up?\"\n\n\"That's all been done,\" he says. \"But it didn't feel like enough.\"\n\nHis 786-page book ends in 1954, when Sinatra was dismissed as a has-been, dropped by his music label and scandalized for leaving his wife, Nancy, and three kids for Ava Gardner. (\"The great love of his life, but a relationship whose DNA was filled with pain.\")\n\nThen Sinatra stages what Kaplan calls \"the greatest comeback in American show business,\" winning an Oscar for his role in From Here to Eternity.\n\nKaplan, 59, a magazine writer, novelist (Two Guys From Verona, which is set in suburban New Jersey) and biographer (co-author of books with Jerry Lewis and former tennis star John McEnroe), says Sinatra was \"the most uncomfortable man in history.\"\n\nIn reading about him, Kaplan says, \"you see the results of the discomfort — the fistfights and temper tantrums and egomania — but you didn't see where it came from. How it was not just all of a piece with the bad behavior, but what made him as great as he was.\"\n\nKaplan concluded that Sinatra, after four marriages and countless affairs, \"was truly happy only when he was doing right by his music, when he was in good voice. Everything else, the sex and the playing around, was in between.\"\n\nThe seeds of Frank were sown at a \"boozy, slightly rowdy\" dinner at a Santa Monica, Calif., restaurant in 2004. Kaplan was finishing Dean & Me, co-authored with Lewis, which grew out of a profile of Lewis that Kaplan wrote for The New Yorker in 2000.\n\nThe dinner was thrown by Lewis' manager, Claudia Stabile, in the midst of preparations for Lewis' annual Muscular Dystrophy Association Telethon. Present were Lewis, singer Jack Jones, bandleader Jack Eglash, guitarist Joe Lano, pianist/arranger Vincent Falcone and Kaplan.\n\n\"We were just sitting around,\" Kaplan recalls. \"They didn't care who I was. I wasn't there as a journalist. I wasn't there on the record. I was just a guy. Their hair was down. And musicians are blunt. They say whatever the hell they feel like saying — and all the more so when they're drunk.\"\n\nSeveral had worked with Sinatra, or \"the Old Man,\" as they called him. Most had known him well.\n\nSo when they began to gossip about Sinatra, Kaplan expected \"the sex stories or the fistfight stories, all the bad behavior. But no. Every story to a man was told in tones of awe about what an absolute genius he was. They talked about his pitch, his way with a lyric, his professionalism, collegiality, and even his vulnerability. And that, to me, was something brand new.\"\n\nKaplan's next stop in Hoboken is 415 Monroe St., Sinatra's birthplace (he was born Dec. 12, 1915), marked by a bronze star in the sidewalk. (The opening scene in Kaplan's book takes place there, a brutal birth. The doctor thought the baby had died. Kaplan writes that Sinatra bore scars of his birth, \"both physical and psychological, to the end of his years. ... He had learned from earliest childhood to trust no one.\")\n\nThe house, now the site of an empty lot, burned down 30 years ago. Next door is a one-room Sinatra museum that closed in 2006.\n\nTo understand Sinatra, Kaplan says, you have to understand his love-hate relationship with his hometown and mother. His father, Marty, a failed prizefighter, was barely a presence.\n\nIn Sinatra's youth, Hoboken was a tough, working-class town, filled with Italian and Irish longshoremen and factory workers. (Now it has been largely, but not totally, gentrified by artists and young professionals who like the 10-minute ferry ride to Manhattan.) But, Kaplan says, \"Frank was never as tough as he wanted everyone to believe.\"\n\nHis mother, however, was \"tough and smart. She was a political ward boss when that meant something. She was always in his face.\" She gave him a charge account at Hoboken's best clothing store. She bought him a sound system and whatever he needed when he started singing (at first, for nickels and quarters, at a bar his father ran).\n\nDolly Sinatra also \"was interested in upward mobility, and she moved the family to a better part of Hoboken, out of what was called Guinea Town. ... But she also hit Frank (with a billy club and once pushed him down a flight of stairs). That was part of the contradiction.\"\n\nLate in life, Sinatra grew sentimental about Hoboken, returning to campaign with Ronald Reagan in 1984, after Sinatra, a onetime liberal Democrat, turned conservative.\n\n\"When he was young, he couldn't wait to get out,\" Kaplan says. He did when he was 20, after he and a music group dubbed The Hoboken Four hit it big on the radio, winning Major Bowes' Original Amateur Hour, the American Idol of its day.\n\nBut \"he was Italian-American to his core, back when Italians literally were not considered to be white,\" Kaplan says. \"To the end of his days, he felt he had come from the wrong side of the tracks and had to prove what he was worth.\"\n\nKaplan never met Sinatra but saw him perform at New York's Carnegie Hall in 1981.\n\n\"I went tongue-in-cheek. He was tubby then, palling around with Spiro Agnew. His image was what Joe Piscopo and Phil Hartman made fun of.\n\n\"But he was fantastic. He was inspired by Carnegie Hall. He\n\nraised his game. In Vegas, he'd play the tough guy like all the tough guys who ran Vegas. But at Carnegie Hall, he was in communion with his better angels. My tongue fell right out of my cheek.\"\n\nThirty years later, Kaplan says, \"Frank was hip-hop before there was hip-hop. I'd love to figure out how many rap songs mention him. He was the essence of cool, the essence of people who make their own rules.\"\n\n'So much more' to write about\n\nThere's no Sinatra plaque outside the grim-looking, century-old school, formerly Hoboken High School, now a middle school, that Sinatra attended for about 50 days before dropping out. He was 15.\n\n\"Look at how severe it looks,\" Kaplan says. \"Can you imagine Frank being confined in a place that like? He used to say he was expelled for rowdiness. But in fact, he just quit. His mother was furious. But he would have been dreaming of girls and of New York and of getting out of Hoboken.\"\n\nKaplan decided that Sinatra's 1954 comeback was \"a dynamic pausing point\" to end on. But he plans a second volume: \"There's the Rat Pack years, and his involvement with the Mob and the Kennedys, and so much more.\"\n\nNear Sinatra's birthplace is Lepore's Home Made Chocolates, locally famous for supplying Sinatra with his favorite: chocolate-covered apricots.\n\nMario Lepore, who helped run the Sinatra museum \"until we ran out of money,\" apologizes that his Sinatra artifacts, including thank-you notes, are in storage. The store is moving elsewhere in Hoboken because the building \"is going condo.\"\n\nLepore is excited to see Kaplan's book and asks, \"What does the family think?\" referring to Sinatra's kids, Tina, Frank Jr. and Nancy. (All declined Kaplan's interview requests.)\n\n\"They haven't seen it yet,\" Kaplan says. \"But it's not a scandal book.\"\n\nLepore recalls Sinatra sitting in a limo while a driver came inside for the chocolates and how he once met him in Atlantic City: \"I felt like I was meeting a prophet. I was mesmerized. When he spoke, no one would interrupt.\"\n\nLepore is discouraged by what he sees as waning local interest in Hoboken's most famous native son and rising interest in its newest local celebrity, baker Buddy Valastro, star of the reality TV show Cake Boss.\n\nKaplan assures him, \"The Cake Boss will come and go. Sinatra will always be with us.\"\n\nYou share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil. Don't attack other readers personally, and keep your language decent.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00002-of-00064--767", "original_text": "Thao Nguyen was riding the New York City subway in 2005 when a man sat down across from her and began to masturbate. She snapped a photo that would wind up on the cover of the New York Daily News under the screaming headline “EXPOSED!”\n\nNguyen told the paper that she tried to file a police report to no avail. So she uploaded the picture to various Web sites in hopes of identifying the perpetrator. The photo went viral (at least by 2005 standards) and police later arrested Dan Hoyt. The following year, New York magazine profiled Hoyt in an article taglined “the story of a raw-food guru turned ‘subway perv.’” Hoyt was eventually sentenced to two years probation.\n\nAs noted in the New York article, Nguyen’s harassment served as inspiration for the anti-street harassment organization, Hollaback, which at the time was a small N.Y.-based organization. A decade later, Hollaback is an international organization that bills itself as “a movement to end street harassment.”\n\nIn October, Hollaback made headlines with a video called “10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman.” That video, produced by Rob Bliss, who owns a viral video marketing agency, has received more than 38 million views on YouTube. The video was criticized as unfairly depicting men of color and Hollaback later apologized.\n\nBut the video, which rounds out Google’s list of the top globally trending YouTube videos of 2014, was also part of what activists have called increased awareness of street harassment and related issues such as sexual assault.\n\nAfter the “10 Hours of Walking” video went viral, Hollaback’s executive director and co-founder, Emily May, said in a phone interview that it was “pleasantly surprising” to see how interested people were in the topic.\n\n“For so long this issue has been sidelined as something that nobody cared about it. It wasn’t important,” May said. “People didn’t even see this as part of a critical feminist agenda, much less a national conversation that needed to be had.”\n\nThe video offered many insights into the complex conversations around street harassment. What exactly constitutes street harassment? Who is affected by it? Who perpetuates it? What does it look like in different communities? Amid those questions, there was a sense that the video — and the varied reactions to it — took an existing and ongoing conversation very public.\n\nMay said she started experiencing street harassment on a regular basis when she moved to New York City.\n\n“I had a lot of shame about it,” May said. “I really saw myself as a strong woman and I was raised by a single mom and I thought that the fact that street harassment impacted me so much meant that I wasn’t strong.”\n\nMay said she tried several approaches from yelling back to “being a one-woman street harassment education machine” to ignoring it completely.\n\n“Nothing really worked and so I just kind of accepted that this was a way of life,” May said. Then in 2005, she and her co-founders — four men and three other women — read Nguyen’s story. “We were just like ‘this woman is our hero — she’s amazing.’”\n\nThe site they launched encouraged victims of street harassment to channel Nguyen, now a member of Hollaback’s advisory board, and send in photos of their harassers. “Our whole idea was just to document this at first,” May said, adding “we thought we were just launching a little blog.”\n\nHollaback — and other organizations like it – has definitely become more than a blog. “This is a social movement,” says Laura S. Logan, a sociologist and activist who has long studied gender-based violence. Logan said she started researching street harassment in 2008. “I saw it as part of a continuum of violence against women,” she said in a phone interview.\n\nOther people are starting to see it that way too, said Logan, who teaches sociology and criminology at Hastings College in Nebraska and is on the Board of Directors for Stop Street Harassment, a nonprofit organization that, like Hollaback, started as a blog.\n\nShe said she sees a connection between the anti-street harassment movement and activism on college campuses around the handling of sexual assault. “That movement is also helping to spotlight the ways in which women are victimized,” Logan said.\n\n“I think that from multiple directions, street harassment is getting some attention — street harassment as it’s experienced by different communities, which just really serves to highlight how common it is and how many people are experiencing it and some of the disastrous things that can happen as a consequence,” Logan said. “And I think that people see it as connected to other kinds of crimes against women.”\n\nStop Street Harassment founder Holly Kearl wrote her master’s thesis on street harassment while a student at George Washington University. She said she experienced it personally as a student, but hadn’t defined it as street harassment until she came across the term while doing research.\n\n“2006 is the first time that I heard the term and I had two degrees – a history degree and also women’s studies,” Kearl said in a phone interview. “I was an activist around rape on campus and a volunteer at a domestic violence shelter, but street harassment was never identified or mentioned and I was dealing with it daily as a college student.”\n\nKearl has since written two books about street harassment. Earlier this year, Stop Street Harassment commissioned a national study, which found that 65 percent of women and 25 percent of men in the United States have experienced some form of street harassment.\n\nIn a two-part blog post on Stop Street Harassment’s Web site, Kearl identified some of the activism, research and events that made 2014 what she calls “the year of the tipping point” in terms of global awareness about street harassment.\n\n“I feel strongly that 2014 has been a turning point year when it comes to raising awareness about street harassment,” Kearl wrote. “No longer is it an obscure term describing something that most people see as normal. Now, many more people have some familiarity with it, and a lot of them find it violating and wrong.”\n\nLogan agrees and points to some of the high-profile cases in which street harassment has escalated to violence. She cited the story of Sakia Gunn, a 15-year-old lesbian who in 2003 was stabbed to death in Newark after rejecting advances from a man. Gunn had told the man that she was gay — the case was later prosecuted as a hate crime.\n\nLogan also thinks that groups like Stop Street Harassment and Hollaback have a lot to do with increasing awareness of street harassment. When it comes to activism, the idea of documenting street harassment — through photos, stories or videos — is a common thread.\n\nIn sharing their stories,”women can not only say ‘hey this is happening,’ but they can see that they’re not the only one it’s happening to. So it becomes a shared grievance,” Logan said.\n\nSocial media has also made it easier for women to share their street harassment stories, whether casually or as part of a collection of anecdotes.\n\nOne example is #YouOkSis, a campaign started by writer and activist Feminista Jones.\n\nJones, who writes (and tweets) under a pseudonym, lives in New York and has written for years about her own experiences with street harassment. In June, Jones tweeted about witnessing a man following a young woman despite her clear attempts to stop the conversation. Jones walked by and asked her simply, “You ok, sis?”\n\nWomen replied with stories of similar harassment or their own efforts to intervene when they saw someone getting harassed. “soooooo many times i wished somebody, ANYBODY, had come to my aid while being harrassed on the street,” one woman tweeted. “IT MATTERS.”\n\n#YouOkSis is particularly resonant for women of color, who experts say are disproportionately affected by street harassment (along with those in the LGBT community).\n\n“There’s this perception that black women are strong,” Jones said in a phone interview. “They don’t need to be saved. They don’t need empathy. They can take care of it. They probably want it.”\n\n#YouOkSis challenges that notion. It’s become more than a hashtag, but it’s still active on Twitter and offers a wide-ranging look at how people experience and perceive street harassment. There’s a fair amount of vitriol from some who argue that street harassment isn’t a problem or assert that victims of street harassment are somehow responsible.\n\nJones said that despite such ridicule, social media has been helpful in putting a spotlight on the issue of street harassment.\n\n“You can’t ignore that street harassment is something that people are tired of and that they’re taking a stand against,” Jones said.\n\nStreet harassment has also been looked at with humor — a plethora of videos spoofed the “10 Hours of Walking in NYC” video (here’s Funny or Die’s take).\n\nIn October, Jessica Williams took “The Daily Show” viewers along on her catcall-filled commute through New York City in a delightfully sarcastic segment called “Jessica’s Feminized Atmosphere.”\n\n“For most guys, it’s just a calm, boring commute, but for me it’s like I’m competing in a beauty pageant every day!” Williams said cheerfully.\n\nIn 2012, comedian W. Kamau Bell took a look at the topic on his FX show, “Totally Biased.” Bell interviewed both men and women to get their opinions on street harassment.\n\nIn a phone interview, Bell said that he hadn’t thought much about street harassment until one of his writers suggested a segment on the topic. At one point, Bell asks a woman how often she experiences street harassment. She responds every day and Bell looks flabbergasted.\n\n“My reaction to the women talking is my actual reaction. When one woman says “every day,” I’m like ‘every day?!,’” Bell recalled.\n\nAt the end of the segment, Bell takes to the streets with a megaphone. “If you think catcalling and street harassment build up a woman’s confidence, you’re right. It makes them confident that you’re a creep!”\n\nBell, who is currently on tour, often incorporates social justice issues into his comedy. He said that he doesn’t specifically mention street harassment during his show, but that it can come up. “There’s a point in my show when I talk about sexism and to me it’s all related,” he said.\n\nAnd when it comes to talking to men about street harassment (as one of the women he interviewed advised him to do), Bell — who now sits on Hollaback’s advisory board — says he encourages them to just listen.\n\n“The problem with the street harassment discussion is that so many men will go — when a woman says ‘this happened to me and it was bad’ — they sort of go, ‘no, it sounds like the guy was complimenting you,’” Bell said. “And dude it’s like, you’re starting the whole conversation in the wrong place if you’re going to disagree with somebody about their personal experience.”\n\nLogan said she believes that the growing awareness of street harassment will eventually lead to changes.\n\n“Because men are learning what street harassment does, why it is so important to stop harassing women, that we have a better chance of men saying ‘Hey, I’m not going to do that. I didn’t realize it,’” Logan said.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nThao Nguyen was riding the New York City subway in 2005 when a man sat down across from her and began to masturbate.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00000-of-00064--175", "original_text": "Last week I gave a talk at the Levy Institute’s 19th annual Hyman P. Minsky Conference, held at the Ford Foundation. The occasion forced me to clarify my thoughts about financial reform; so here’s a version of what I said.\n\nWhen health reform passed and the subject shifted to financial reform, I know that I wasn’t the only policy wonk/pundit who groaned a bit. Health reform, for all the complexities of its details, was a pretty clear issue; there was almost a theorem-theorem-lemma feel to figuring out what had to be done, leading you to something like the actual reform we got. Yes, there should have been a public option. But the basic structure of the issue was clear.\n\nFinancial reform is a much messier debate. It doesn’t break down simply on some left-right axis, although that’s there too. Instead, there are a bunch of competing views of what the problem is all about. In fact, by my count there are six such views. They’re not all mutually exclusive, but it matters which of the six you place at the top of the list.\n\nNow, I have a personal opinion: basically, I believe in view #2, with some allowance for #3 and #4 too. But before I defend my version, let me lay out the list of candidates for explaining the mess we’re in. Later on, I’ll also describe three visions of financial reform, again along with my personal preference.\n\nSo: what’s the problem? Here are the views I see out there.\n\n- Size: Our largest financial institutions have just gotten too big - Shadows: The rise of shadow banking, institutions that fulfill banking functions but evade the regulatory regime, has undermined stability - Opacity: We’ve come to rely on complex financial instruments that neither regulators nor the private sector - Predation: Financial firms deliberately misled consumers and investors - Government intervention: Public policy pushed lenders into making bad loans, especially to the poor - Monetary mismanagement: The Fed did it by keeping interest rates too low for too long, and/or policymakers panicked in 2008 and spooked the markets\n\nLet me now discuss each of these at a bit more length.\n\nSize: Clearly, there was a massive increase in financial concentration, with a few true behemoths emerging. It’s easy to argue that this creates moral hazard, because the giant firms know that they’re too big to fail – which is also an easy slogan to remember. The idea that size is the problem has gained a lot of credibility from Paul Volcker, who personally embodies the truth of too big to fail (if you’ve ever met him); more seriously, Volcker has argued strongly that the repeal of Glass-Steagall, allowing financial firms to grow big in part by merging conventional banking with investment activities, set the stage for the crisis.\n\nMy view is that I’d love to see those financial giants broken up, if only for political reasons: it’s bad to have banks so big they can often write laws. But I’m not sold on the centrality of too big to fail to the crisis, for reasons best explained in terms of the second doctrine.\n\nShadows: I’m very much a Diamond-Dybvig guy – that is, I think of financial crises in terms of the Diamond-Dybvig model of bank runs. The basic idea is that what banks do – what makes them useful – is the way they let investors satisfy their desire for liquid, short-term assets while using most of those investor funds to finance illiquid, long-term projects. The key is the law of large numbers, which lets banks keep only a fraction of deposits in liquid form.\n\nThe problem, as Diamond and Dybvig pointed out, is that such institutions are vulnerable to runs: if something leads investors to fear for the soundness of a bank, they will all try to withdraw their funds – and in so doing can break even a fundamentally solvent institution. The solution, said D&D, was deposit insurance. Of course, this leads to possible problems of moral hazard, so deposit insurance has to be further supported with bank regulation.\n\nAll of this, however, failed to take account of shadow banking – the rise of institutions that were banks in the Diamond-Dybvig sense, engaging in liquidity and maturity transformation, but weren’t classified as banks for regulatory purposes. Hyman Minsky, by the way, saw this coming: he wrote at some length about the rise of what he called “fringe banking”, by which he meant essentially the same thing Paul McCulley of Pimco meant when he coined the phrase shadow banking. And so we recreated the vulnerabilities of the pre-1930s banking system.\n\nNow here’s the thing: there’s nothing in this story about too big to fail. Indeed, the banks in the Diamond-Dybvig paper are atomistic. And it’s worth remembering both that Lehman wasn’t all that big and that the great banking collapse of 1930-31 began at a Bronx-based bank that was only the 28th-ranked bank in America.\n\nOpacity: Warren Buffett’s warning about derivatives as weapons of mass financial destruction looks prescient. To update an old joke: what do you get when you cross a Godfather with an investment banker? Someone who makes you an offer you can’t understand. It’s easy to argue that the emergence of securities and contracts with obscure, hidden risks contributed to the crisis.\n\nPredation: Clearly, a substantial amount of subprime lending was predatory – as Ned Gramlich argued, the most complex, confusing loans were offered to those least able to analyze them. There was probably also a substantial amount of deliberate selling of mortgage-backed securities to investors who didn’t grasp the risks. And there may be more issues regarding vampire squids and all that. [Note: the talk was given before the Goldman news broke].\n\nGovernment intervention: A large part of America’s political spectrum believes, as an article of faith, that do-gooding politicians caused the crisis – that the Community Reinvestment Act forced banks to lend to minority groups, and that Fannie/Freddie were responsible for the bubble.\n\nI won’t spend much time on this, since it’s easy to refute. The CRA was around for almost 30 years before the problems in subprime began to develop; anyway, most subprime lenders weren’t even covered by the act. And the worst of the housing bubble developed at a time when Fannie and Freddie, under pressure over accounting scandals, were actually withdrawing from the market.\n\nNonetheless, it’s important to know that a lot of people believe that Barney Frank did it – and nothing will convince them otherwise.\n\nMonetary mismanagement: Leaving aside the neo-Austrians and the likes of Ron Paul, there are some serious economists who blame monetary policy for the bubble, and also argue that bad handling of the Lehman aftermath made things much worse than they needed to be; I’d mention John Taylor in particular.\n\nMy counterargument would be that while it’s certainly possible to make the case that monetary policymakers made mistakes, it’s hard to accuse them of sheer idiocy. There were good reasons for low rates in 2002-4; to argue that the Fed should have tightened is to argue that it should have ignored a weak economy and disinflation that seemed to threaten actual deflation, in favor of what at the time were hypothetical concerns about asset prices. As for the argument that Henry Paulson and company bobbled the response after Lehman, we can discuss the particulars; but my view is that a financial system that works only if we always have wise, well-spoken public officials is a system we can’t rely on.\n\nSo with these various doctrines in mind, what can we say about financial reform?\n\nActually, let me first pose a question. It seems to me that to judge proposals for reform, we have to ask why we managed to do so well for so long. There was a long era, what Gary Gorton calls the Quiet Period, when banking panics were virtually absent. How did we do that?\n\nDeposit insurance was certainly part of the answer. But how did we mostly avoid, until the savings and loan scandals, the moral hazard such insurance can create? Regulation, especially limits on leverage, surely helped. But Gorton and other have suggested that an important part of the story was the simple fact that banking wasn’t very competitive: with limits on the interest banks could pay, coupled with barriers to entry, banks had a large franchise value – and this made bankers reluctant to take risks that could kill the cash cow that kept laying golden eggs, or something like that.\n\nIf that’s true, the reforms now on the table probably won’t be enough. Back to that in a minute.\n\nAt this point I’d identify three forms of reform proposal.\n\nOne version basically calls on the government to rely on market discipline: it should swear by all that’s holy never to bail out financial firms again, and rely on the threat of failure to keep bankers from taking on excessive risk. You hear this mainly from the likes of Mitch McConnell, but some of what Paul Volcker has said also seems to lean in this direction.\n\nBut it’s an illusion, of course. In 1930 we let banks fail – and the result was the Great Depression. In 2008 Paulson tried letting Lehman fail – and within days he was staring into the abyss. We are not going to let systemically important financial firms fail, nor should we. As a commenter on my blog said, failure is not an option – it’s a CDS.\n\nA second version of reform calls for a full recreation of the Quiet Period banking system. We’ll reinstate Glass-Steagall, protect the depository institutions, and let the investment banks sink or swim.\n\nAgain, I don’t think this is realistic. Shadow banking isn’t going away. Like it or not, repo and other short-term debts now play a role in our economy comparable to that of bank deposits, and pretending that stabilizing depository institutions is enough just won’t fly.\n\nWhich brings me to the third version, which is more or less what the Frank and Dodd bills are trying to do: don’t literally recreate the Quiet Period system, but try to create a 21st-century version thereof.\n\nRather oddly, there hasn’t been much discussion of formally extending something like deposit insurance to the short-term liabilities of shadow banks; but as it stands, there’s probably enough of an implicit guarantee to do the job. Add in resolution authority, so that shadow banks can be easily seized just like depository institutions, and you’ve got something like a super-FDIC.\n\nBut what about prudential regulation to limit the moral hazard? Limits on leverage are an obvious necessity – but I am worried about how easily they can be enforced. Derivatives reform, necessary in its own right, could help here, reducing the options for hiding exposure, but you still have the feeling that determined bankers could evade the rules.\n\nAnyway, what if the stability of the Quiet Period rested largely on franchise value? The problem here is that no policymaker can explicitly call for restoring that aspect of the financial world: let’s make the banks fat, happy, and sleepy is not a slogan anyone wants to run on.\n\nI guess you could argue that the de facto results of the crisis – a more concentrated, less competitive banking system – have actually recreated some of the missing franchise value. But again, nobody is going to adopt maintaining this state of affairs as a deliberate goal.\n\nSo where does that leave us? For sure we have to try to update financial regulation for the 21st century, and for sure doing so will help avert the worst in the future. But I have to admit that I’m not wildly optimistic about just how successful we’ll be.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nLast week I gave a talk at the Levy Institute’s 19th annual Hyman P.

And when I say \"bad,\" I mostly mean they're just poorly made and, ultimately, no fun to play. It seems some game developers and publishers think they can dash games together and market them to kids ... and that the kids just won't notice.\n\nBut they will notice. And so will we parents. So what is a discerning grownup with a game-filled wish-list to do?\n\nRead on for some tips on how to buy great games for your children this holiday ... and maybe save some money to boot. In addition to the tips, we've sifted through the garbage and selected some of the best games to give to the young players in your life.\n\nTip No. 1: Check the ratings\n\nVideo game boxes come with ratings designed specifically to help parents know which titles are appropriate for which ages. Games that are most appropriate for the youngest players will be marked with an \"EC\" for early childhood and \"E\" for \"everyone.\" Games marked \"E10+\" are for those 10 years and older and \"T\" designates games appropriate for teens.\n\nGame boxes also include additional content descriptors, which explain exactly what kind of potentially inappropriate material a game might contain (blood, comic mischief, crude humor, etc). For a look at exactly what the ratings and descriptors mean, follow this link.\n\nLittle Big Planet Karting (PlayStation 3, Rated E) — All of the LittleBigPlanet games are an absolute joy to play not to mention very family friendly. \"LittleBigPlanet,\" \"LittleBigPlanet 2\" and the new \"LittleBig PlanetKarting\" all take place in a lovely craft-made world, all encourage players to put their own imagination to use and all are rated E for Everyone. The newly launched \"LBP Karting\" game is sure to please the kid in your house who loves cars, loves zipping around and loves the idea of creating their own race courses.\n\nSkylanders Giants (all platforms, Rated E10+) — There's no other way to put it: the E10+ rated Skylanders games — \"Skylanders\" and the new \"Skylanders: Giants\" — are kid gaming genius. These family-friendly titles combine action-adventure gaming with collectible toys in a way that is a whole lot of fun (if a bit hard on a parents' wallets). If this game is on your children's wish-list, know that they will get hours and hours of fun out of these games and the toys that go with them. (And you can read more about that right here.)\n\nTip No. 2. Be careful when buying games based on movies or TV shows\n\nIf your kid loves, loves, LOVES a particular movie or TV show, they may think they'll also love the game based on that movie or TV show. But you may want to think twice. I'm not going to name any names here (mostly because the list would be too long), but a great many of the video games based on film and television properties are often quite poor in quality.\n\nMany of these games are slapped together quickly so they arrive at the same time the movie does, and the companies that make them rely on people's excitement about the film or TV show (rather than good gameplay) to send them flying off shelves. Before you buy one of these games, be especially sure to check multiple reviews and then consider gently urging your child to wish for something else.\n\nAll that said, there are some really good games based on favorite properties ...\n\nKinect Sesame Street TV (Xbox 360, Rated EC) — Talk about your beloved TV programming. \"Kinect Sesame Street TV\" is made for the very youngest people in your household. But really, it is less of a game than it is a season of interactive Sesame Street episodes.\n\nMaking use of the Kinect sensor, it encourages young viewers to interact with characters such as Big Bird and Grover by doing simple things such as waving their arms and jumping around. While I have found that getting the Kinect sensor to properly detect little kids can be quite challenging, \"Kinect Sesame Street TV\" uses motion controls only at their most basic and works very well. And the nice thing is, your kid won't just be sitting there staring at the TV — they'll be up on their feet and actively engaged.\n\nLEGO Lord of the Rings (all game machines, Rated: E10+) — Like the \"LEGO: Star Wars,\" \"LEGO: Indiana Jones\" and \"LEGO: Harry Potter\" games that came before, this LEGO-fied action-adventure game based on the \"The Lord of the Rings\" movies is a ton of family-friendly fun. Here the famed films and characters are given a blocky LEGO makeover and are brought to life with a zippy sense of humor. And thanks to the two-player co-operative mode, you can play right along side your youngster.\n\nTip No. 3. Consider some of the great older games your kid hasn't played\n\nYour child doesn't necessarily need the latest and greatest (and most expensive) video games to be happy this holiday. If you've got a young gamer in the house, then they probably haven't had a chance to play many of the truly wonderful games from years past. Picking up a game that is a year or two old is not only a way to introduce them to some excellent gaming experiences, it's a good way to save a bit of money at the same time since many of these titles will be discounted.\n\nIt's also worth considering some of the great older games that have been reissued. For more on that...\n\nKirby's Dream Collection (Wii, Rated E) — As Nintendo president Satoru Iwata told me in an interview earlier this year, the excellent and long-running Kirby game series was specifically designed as a way to open up gaming to even the youngest and newest of players. In celebration of Kirby's 20th anniversary, Nintendo released this superb collection of six games that have starred that adorable pink blob over the last two decades. \"Kirby's Dream Collection\" also comes with bonus videos, music and historical material — so you can school your child in what gaming was like back in the \"olden days.\"\n\nOkami, Okami HD (Wii, PlayStation 3, Rated T) — This gorgeously animated action-adventure game starring a sun goddess in the shape of a white wolf was met with rave reviews when it first arrived back in 2006 for the PlayStation 2, and two years later for the Wii. Meanwhile, earlier this year a remastered HD version was released for the PlayStation 3. No matter which version you pick up, this game will delight any player with its stunning Japanese water-color-painting style graphics and its epic, magical adventure.\n\nTip No. 4. Consider buying a used game\n\nSpeaking of saving money ... buying used is a great way to go when purchasing any video game. But while you may feel a bit awkward buying a used gift for a grown-up this holiday season, I'm willing to bet that if you put some fresh wrapping paper on a gently used game, your kid won't care (or even notice).\n\nNew Super Mario Bros. Wii (Wii, Rated E) — If you haven't had the chance (or the money) to upgrade from a Wii game machine to Nintendo's new Wii U machine, not to worry. The good news is, you'll be able to find many used Wii games for some very good prices. A used version of the excellent \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" from 2009 can be found on Amazon for $30 (rather than the $50 you'll pay for a new copy.)\n\nRayman Origins (all game machines, Rated E10+) — My son and I have absolutely loved playing \"Rayman Origins\" together. In fact, it's one of my very favorite games from last year. And this colorful, wickedly wacky platformer filled with great original music can be found used for as low as $12 (rather than the new asking price of $20).\n\nTip No. 5. Sometimes the best kid's games are not necessarily made for kids\n\nBy this, I don't necessarily mean you should let your children play Mature-rated games, I'm just saying that you don't always need to shop specifically for \"children's\" video games when you're looking for a good game for your child. Some of the best games out there are enjoyable, appropriate and were made for players of ALL ages.\n\nJourney (PlayStation 3, E10+) — This isn't a kid's game per se, but it's still a great game to introduce to young players. \"Journey\" takes players on — just as its name suggests — an epic journey full of wonder and mystery. Players guide a character across vast deserts and through mysterious snowy lands as they try to reach a mountain in the distance. There is little in the way of violence and much in the way of stunning visuals and artistry. And right now you can buy \"Journey\" packaged together in a collector's edition with two other excellent, kid-appropriate games — \"Flower\" and \"Flow\" — from the same developer.\n\nParents and gamers, please head over to the comments section to suggest other great kids games or offer other buying suggestions.\n\nAnd for more gaming-related gift ideas check out this story: Love a gamer?

They spoke of bleeding patients arriving far faster than they could be treated, lined up on gurneys in hallways.\n\n“It was singularly the worst day of my career and the best day of my career, and it was probably the same for every person standing here,” Dr. Chadwick P. Smith said.\n\nIn Washington, President Obama on Tuesday reiterated that investigators had found no evidence that the gunman, Omar Mateen, had actual contact with a larger terrorist group like the Islamic State. Mr. Mateen declared allegiance to that group during the nightclub assault.\n\n“It is increasingly clear, however, that the killer took in extremist information and propaganda over the internet,” Mr. Obama said. “He appears to have been angry, disturbed, unstable young man who became radicalized.”\n\n“These lone actors or small cells of terrorists are very hard to detect and very hard to prevent,” he said. “We are doing everything in our power to stop these kinds of attacks.”\n\nReferring to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, the president said: “I want to remind them that they are not alone. The American people and our allies, friends all of the world, stand with you and are thinking about you and are praying for you.”\n\nThe F.B.I. was continuing to look into Mr. Mateen, 29, who died in a shootout with the police, for evidence of motive, possible accomplices, or links to terrorist groups. Mr. Mateen had voiced hatred of gays, minorities and Jews, and had claimed links to Islamist terrorist groups. But investigators were also looking into reports that he might have been gay, himself.\n\nAt the hospital news conference, Mr. Colon recounted an enjoyable night coming to an end at Pulse, a nightclub popular with Orlando’s gay Latinos, when shortly after 2 a.m., as he and his friends were exchanging goodbye hugs, a barrage of gunshots rang out. Like the rest of the panicked crowd of more than 300 in the club, he ran for the door, but three bullets hit his leg and he fell.\n\n“I tried to get back up but everyone started running everywhere, I got trampled over, and I shattered and broke my bones in my left leg,” he said. “All I could do was just lay down while everyone was just running on top of me, trying to get to where they had to be.”\n\nHe heard more gunshots and screaming, as the gunman apparently went to a back room, and then returned.\n\n“He’s shooting everyone that’s already dead on the floor, making sure they’re dead,” Mr. Colon said. “I look over, and he shoots the girl next to me. And I’m just there laying down and I’m thinking ‘I’m next, I’m dead.’ So I don’t know how, but by the glory of God, he shoots toward my head but it hits my hand, and then he shoots me again and it hits the side of my hip. I had no reaction. I was just prepared to just stay there laying down so he won’t know that I’m alive.”\n\nThen the killer traded gunfire with arriving police officers, retreating to another room. An officer entered, found Mr. Colon still alive, and dragged him through broken glass, cutting his back and legs, to the street and then to a nearby Wendy’s, where, he recalled,“there’s just bodies everywhere.”\n\n“I wish I could remember his face or his name,” Mr. Colon said of the officer. “I’m grateful for him.”\n\nDoctors at the medical center said they ordinarily would get some warning that wounded were coming, as well as information about the number of patients and their conditions. But not in this case, with a chaotic mass shooting scene just blocks from the hospital. Patients arrived in trucks and cars, and on foot, as well as in ambulances.\n\n“We quickly got about five patients, and that was a lot for us, and we thought maybe that was going to be it,” said Dr. Kathryn Bondani. “And then they started lining up in the hallway.”\n\nThe medical center and other hospitals were grappling with the worst mass shooting in United States history — 49 dead, in addition to the gunman, and 53 wounded. Forty-four patients were taken to the medical center, the region’s only trauma center, and nine of them died quickly. No other patients have died since that night.\n\nOne of the six patients was still in critical condition.\n\n“I would consider them to be profoundly ill,” said Dr. Michael Cheatham. “I suspect that they will survive, but my concern is that they will have lasting harm from this, in terms of their functionality.”\n\nDoctors said they saw small-caliber and larger-caliber gunshot wounds, indicating that the gunman used both of the weapons he had with him, an AR-15 type of assault rifle, which fires small, high-velocity rounds, and a semiautomatic handgun.\n\nOn Tuesday, the entire block surrounding the Pulse nightclub remained blocked off with a black-screened fence, with a wider area cordoned off with yellow police tape. Businesses — fast food restaurants, gas stations and retail stores — were closed, and a heavy contingent of news media stood nearby.\n\nAshley Summers was at the Pulse nightclub when an assailant began shooting. She tells her story and reflects on the trauma the attack has left on her Florida community.\n\nThe night before, thousands of people gathered on a grassy knoll in downtown Orlando for a candlelight vigil that was by turns defiant and melancholy.\n\n“We have come together as a force here in Orlando that cannot be broken,” said Terry DeCarlo, the executive director of the LBT Community Center of Central Florida.\n\nMourners sang the sports fight song, “I believe that we will win.”\n\nBut moments later, during about 10 minutes of silence, tears flowed and embraces tightened, as the crowd lifted candles into the air and a church bell tolled.\n\n“Numb,” Elayane Merriwether, a 25-year-old bartender who lost a co-worker in the shooting, said of the city’s mood. “People just keep crying. People don’t know what to say to each other. I think a lot of people are still in shock.”\n\nThousands of others gathered in cities around the country, including New York and Los Angeles, to remember the victims. Outside the Stonewall Inn in Manhattan, where the modern gay rights movement was started, speakers bemoaned not only the assault at the gay nightclub, but also the lack of action in Congress to pass comprehensive gun control legislation.\n\nThe authorities and Orlando’s tight-knit gay community were still trying to come to terms with what had motivated Mr. Mateen, as news reports surfaced that he may have visited the nightclub several times before the shooting. Several people who said they frequented the club told The New York Times in interviews that they had never seen Mr. Mateen before.\n\nThe F.B.I. was also looking into reports that Mr. Mateen had used a gay dating app, a senior federal law enforcement official said.\n\nHis ex-wife, Sitora Yusufiy, said that Mr. Mateen might have been gay and chosen to hide it. Ms. Yusufiy said Mr. Mateen had told her that he had frequented nightclubs before their marriage, but had not described them as gay clubs.\n\nHis father, Seddique Mateen, has said his son was enraged by gay people. Asked on Tuesday if he had seen any indication that Mr. Mateen, himself, was gay, the father said “none whatsoever.”\n\nInvestigators must now try to determine how much the killings were the act of a deeply disturbed man, as his former wife and others described him, and how much he was driven by religious or political ideology.\n\nMr. Obama has called the attack “an example of the kind of homegrown extremism that all of us have been concerned about.”\n\nJames B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, said Mr. Mateen had clearly been “radicalized,” at least in part via the internet. “So far, we see no indication that this was a plot directed from outside the United States, and we see no indication that he was part of any kind of network,” Mr. Comey said.\n\nOvernight, the last of the victims’ names were posted, ending a heart-wrenching process that had played out during the day as families learned the fate of their loved ones.\n\nWhile the shooting exacted a heavy toll on the gay and Latino populations — the events occurred on Latin night at Pulse, and most of the victims were Latino — the impact here was felt far beyond those spheres.\n\n“This is just, it’s just my home and it should be a place where everyone feels safe,” Rachel Luce-Hitt, 34, said at the vigil as she clutched a bundle of purple and yellow flowers. She fought off tears, and her voice trailed off as a woman approached offering her a “free hug.”\n\nWhile she said she did not cry on Sunday after the initial news of the shooting, Ms. Luce-Hitt said, she began weeping Monday morning as she drove to her job in the diversity and inclusion office at the University of Central Florida. Her emotions, she said, were set off when the names of the victims began surfacing.\n\n“When you hear names and you start, like, these are real people with real families that are really hurting,” she said. “It’s a shock at first, but I was like, ‘What have we lost?’ ”\n\nJohn Eligon reported from Orlando, and Richard Pérez-Peña from New York.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00001-of-00064--467", "original_text": "Mario Williams has adjusted well to Houston's transition to the 3-4, recording two sacks and forcing a fumble in the first two weeks.\n\nIn the past couple of seasons, it became a running story in the viewing room at NBC, as the cast of Football Night in America, including me, watched the Houston Texans take a lead into the fourth quarter and consistently and arduously find a way to blow it.\n\nOne week they'd get steamrollered with the run by Chris Johnson, another week they'd fumble it away and the defense couldn't make a stop, another week some quarterback would shred a Houston secondary playing with cement feet. Maddening.\n\n\"You're not the only one I heard that from,'' Texans linebacker and defensive captain DeMeco Ryans told me this week. \"I've gotten that so much from friends the last couple of years. 'Y'all always get up, then find some way to lose it at the end.' We know. We felt that. And coming into this year, we knew we had to find some way to change that.''\n\nSo far, so good ... with an asterisk. In the first two weeks of the season, Kerry Collins and the Peyton-less Colts, then Chad Henne and the Dolphins, were no match for the Texans' new Wade Phillips-choreographed defense. The Texans held Indy and Miami to 20 points in eight quarters. Now comes the real test: Drew Brees and the Saints, at the Superdome, Sunday at high noon in New Orleans.\n\n\"Everybody's been talking like that,'' said Ryans, \"but we're not making it any bigger than any other game. Our mindset each week is to go 1-0.''\n\nWell, OK. But going 1-0 this week is going to be a lot harder than it was either of the previous two weeks. What has the Texans encouraged is how they're playing against the pass and on third down. Those were two big problem areas for the team, as these numbers (table, above) show:\n\nAll the commotion on the Houston defense in the early going has been Mario Williams' adjustment from a down defensive end in the 4-3 to the weakside outside linebacker in the 3-4, playing next to Ryans. Williams has been good to very good so far. Three other new Texans have made the defense work well, too: left end J.J. Watt (first-round pick from Wisconsin) and two new secondary guys acquired in free agency, free safety Danieal Manning and cornerback Johnathan Joseph.\n\nWatt debuted with a bang against the Colts, pressuring Collins five times. Manning has played every snap and been a steadying influence for a young group, and Joseph, before injuring his ankle against Miami (he should be fine this week), has been the kind of physical presence at corner -- and a good cover guy -- Houston GM Rick Smith hoped he'd be when he outbid Detroit for him in July.\n\n\"It's easy to see the impact of Joseph and Manning,'' Ryans said. \"It's confidence. Our young guys back there, instead of going into a play and thinking, 'Don't get beat deep,' now they're thinking, 'I'm going to make this play. I can jump this route.' When you've got veterans back there who've made so many plays, you have more faith in your own game.''\n\nRyans, like many of his teammates, is new to Phillips' 3-4. \"I've taken a liking to it more than I thought I would,'' he said. \"It allows you to disguise what you're doing better than in the 4-3. In the 4-3, the ends have to show their hand. It's hard to run the fire zones [the zone blitzes when defensive linemen drop in coverage] with the 4-3, but now I feel we're not as limited in what we can do.''\n\nAll sounds good now. The matchup of the weekend -- the one I'll be watching with the most interest Sunday afternoon -- is this one. Houston-New Orleans will tell us a lot about whether the Texans have really changed on defense, and whether they'll be real challengers to the AFC elite come January.\n\nThis week's \"NFL Podcast With Peter King'' guest is Baltimore pass-rusher Terrell Suggs, and, as is his custom, he had interesting things to say about the Steelers, movies and being the bad guy.\n\nYou can find the podcast on iTunes and on SI.com.\n\nSuggs on the intensity of the Steelers-Ravens rivalry: \"I love being public enemy No. 1. It's the greatest honor, I think, that I can have against the Pittsburgh Steelers ... On the first third down of last season, when they played here [Baltimore], we got to Ben and we broke his nose ... And that was awesome. I mean, you don't want to hurt anybody, but it just goes to show how physical and grueling this game is. And then early in the third quarter I get my mouth busted. So, I love the simple fact that there was a lot of blood and gore in that game. I tell my mom and my daughter all the time, we're barbarians, we're the gladiators of our time. Him with the broken nose, blood coming out, me with the busted mouth, that game couldn't get any better than that.''\n\nSuggs on the rules to protect defenseless players: \"I think [the NFL] is getting too soft ... I think it's a disgrace. It's a disgrace to everybody who loves this game. Now don't get me wrong, I don't want to see anybody get hurt ... With that being said, we knew the risk we were taking when we decided we wanted to play professional football. Like I said, some guys are trying to hurt people -- we don't need that in our game. But a great hit, a physical great hit, that's football and you can't take that away. Now the protection over the pansy-ass quarterbacks is a disgrace also.''\n\nSuggs on his favorite recent movie: \"I loved Black Swan. ... I loved that it kept me on the edge. I loved that they showed the things dancers go through. A lot of people don't respect dance, but you've got to master that just like you master being a football player, just like being a journalist or a surgeon. And it really captured and showed that.''\n\nNext week, I'm going to try something different on the podcast. We'll have a good guest -- still being finalized -- and we're going to hear from one of my favorite writers in the country, Bob McGinn of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, to help me preview the Week 4 games. You've got to listen to Bob, one of the best football writers in America.\n\nPhiladelphia WR Steve Smith (No. 11). Eli Manning's favorite receiver for three years (Smith caught 107 balls for the Giants in 2009) is just 26, but the Giants allowed him to go to the Eagles in free agency after last season because Smith was recovering from microfracture surgery in his knee, which is always a dangerous career harbinger. But he's recovered well, and he should be on the field for 20 or so snaps in three- and four-wide formations Sunday in the Eagles' home opener. Knowing how much Smith wants to show the Giants they made a big mistake in letting him walk, look for Mike Vick to find Smith a few times.\n\n1. Fakery. Giants safety Deon Grant's diving Monday night got the league's attention, and I hope any further delay-of-game tactics will be met with penalties and fines. I saw that Tampa Bay coach Raheem Morris called the practice \"great coaching technique.'' I call it bush league.\n\n2. Mike Vick's head. Expect Vick, recovering from a concussion, to play Sunday against the Giants. Expect Andy Reid to call zero designed runs. Expect Vick to run some anyway; it's who he is. Expect Vick not to last 16 starts. By the way, how weird is it that Vick got dinged by his own guy, in his own pocket?\n\n3. Matt Ryan's health. Underrated injury note of this week: Ryan barely worked Thursday in practice, recovering from a couple of whacks to the knee Sunday night against Philly. Ryan's taken 17 hits in the first two games of the season. Atlanta offensive coordinator Mike Mularkey has to find a way to throw more curls and intermediate stuff to keep his quarterback upright.\n\n4. More offense. Record point totals, record passing yards, record fun in the first two weeks of the season. When Matt Hasselbeck riddles the Ravens for 348 yards and Cam Newton has more 400-yard passing games in his first two games than Tom Brady had in his first 145, you know it's shaping up to be fill-the-air-with-footballs season.\n\n5. Miami as road warriors, or a road worry. The stats are bizarre. The Dolphins have lost 11 of 12 at home, and won six of their past eight on the road. They enter a stretch of five road games in their next six outings Sunday at Cleveland. A winnable game, obviously, but how does anyone know which Henne shows up at Cleveland Browns Stadium?\n\n6. Jay Cutler running for his life. Rookie right tackle Gabe Carimi, out, turnstile Frank Omiyale in. Hand it to Matt Forte 38 times against the Pack, Mike Martz. Last week Cutler was kicked in the throat at New Orleans. Wonder which body part will take the biggest hit Sunday.\n\n7. Colin Baxter. He hadn't snapped the ball to Mark Sanchez until Nick Mangold was lying on the field last Sunday in New Jersey with a high ankle sprain. Now the undrafted college free-agent center (waived by the Chargers, signed by the Jets) makes his first career start in a sold-out Black Hole, with Richard Seymour, Tommy Kelly and John Henderson -- with 29 combined years of NFL experience knocking around kids like Baxter -- trying to grind him into the turf. Should be interesting.\n\n8. Tony Romo. Expect Romo to play Monday night against Washington with his broken rib and partially collapsed lung, but in this week's Shameless Plug Dept., you can find out for sure Friday evening when he's a guest on our Versus NFL preview show at 6 p.m. ET. Russ Thaler, Mike Florio and I will get the goods out of Romo, whom we'll interview after Dallas' practice this afternoon.\n\n9. Andy Dalton to A.J. Green. Last week in Denver, they became the first rookie combo to connect on 10 passes in a game. \"They're really starting to be good together,'' offensive coordinator Jay Gruden said this week. We can see that.\n\n10. Indy trying to keep America from changing the channel Sunday night. It looks bad for the Colts, with the Steelers coming to town. Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis, start your engines.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00005-of-00064--638", "original_text": "In their new book, \"Pump and Dump: The Rancid Rules of the New Economy,\" sociology professors Robert H. Tillman and Michael L. Indergaard say that recent corporate scandals such as Enron and WorldCom are symptoms of corporate governance problems that began in the 1990s.\n\nUsing a financial fraud theory called \"pump and dump,\" corporate elite artificially inflated stocks and securities in order to sell their shares at higher prices, leaving any fall-out and responsibility on naive investors.\n\nTillman and Indergaard, who both teach at St. John's University in New York City, were online Wednesday, Feb. 22 at 1 p.m. ET to answer questions about their book.\n\nMichael L. Indergaard: Hello and thanks for joining us to discuss the problem of corporate corruption. In our book, \"Pump and Dump: the Rancid Rules of the New Economy\", we show why recent financial scandals implicate the U.S. system of corporate governance and a host of politicians who have cashed in on the public trust. Our hope is that citizens will take a closer look at the business and political elites who hide behind free market mantras.\n\nRobert H. Tillman: Welcome. We're looking forward to your comments.\n\nRockville, Md.: I am curious why two sociology professors would be writing a book on business. What are your backgrounds that you would feel comfortable addressing these issues? Have either of you worked in the finance area? While many of the problems that have emerged over the past 10 years have been pretty egregious, I find that enforcement of our laws is much better today than it was in earlier eras. The Rockefellers, Mellons, Goulds, Kennedys and Morgans of those eras got away with quite a bit and never had much in the way of negative repercussions. Even in the 70's and 80's there were plenty of businessmen whose activities today would justify prison time, but who got away with it. Sure, there are problems today, but at least now there are ramifications.\n\nRobert H. Tillman: Good question. My specialty in sociology is white-collar crime and my colleague's is primarily in economic sociology. Many of the issues we explore in our book can get technical but at their root are not that difficult to understand. We focus on cases of blatant frauds where it is clear that those involved intended to deceive investors, employees, etc.\n\nYou're probably right that there were many violations in the past but one of the differences is that today there are so many more opportunities to commit corporate crimes. With new financial instruments, IPOs, etc.\n\nBethesda, Md.: In your book, do you offer-up any solutions on how to avoid messes like Enron or WorlCom? Are there regulations in place to stop \"pump and dump\" schemes and if not what should be done by the SEC or Congress?\n\nMichael L. Indergaard: Thanks for the question. Sarbanes-Oxley addressed some problems but there have been attempts to water it down. More generally, strong resistance to reform is threatening to bring it to a halt. We propose that there has been little recognition of larger problems of governance and policy.\n\nRobert H. Tillman: Some of the necessary reforms have been implemented, like requiring companies to expense stock options--which has finally been put in place after much wrangling. But others have not. Such as requiring boards of directors to have outside members. I worry that as memory of the scandals fades people will be less vigalent about seeing that reform measures stay in place\n\nPhiladelphia, Pa.: I asked this same following to John Bogle earlier. I would please appreciate your reaction this query:\n\nI was in an Ivy League business school in the 1970s. I recall being the only person in one class who felt that American businesses operating in foreign countries should follow the business laws of the countries within which they operate even if no American laws were broken by breaking the foreign law. I felt this was not only a moral question but also one that shows we respect the cultures of the people with whom we do business. This is just one example of what I found to be a rampant problem among my classmates. What I observed among my classmates was a cut-throat drive for personal success at nearly any cost. I can verify the tales that many college students have heard as being correct: library readings for classes were often missing (this was the days before the Internet), cheating was rampant and indeed widely boasted, and I learned never to work in a group. The object of learning groups was to stab others in the back in order to lower the class average. From all this, I did learn one valuable lesson: never hire anyone from my class to work for me.\n\nOver time, as I watched and read about many of my classmates in the news taken away from their jobs in handcuffs, I was not in the least bit surprised. The question I have always wondered though is, if I could tell within minutes that I would never want these greedy cheaters working for me, how did they get hired and kept at these brokerage houses and businesses? Do many businesses themselves actually seek out cheating greedy people? Or do they worm their way into these businesses, in which case I feel sorry for the businesses when they find the personal spending accounts of these employees inflated and the business deals they made turned out to be ethically questionable.\n\nIs there a business culture among some companies that attracts these people? If so, shouldn't there be a means for this culture to recognize when mistakes are made and can then to respond to correct itself and its own behavior? Did businesses never learn to look for warning signs and self-correct their own problems?\n\nMichael L. Indergaard: Interesting issue. Leading figures in fraud often surrounded themselves with people who were willing to collaborate in dubious activities. They often selected people who were drawn to risk-taking and the prospects of high rewards. Importantly, the ringleaders also created organizational routines and cultures that socialized people into going along with suspect activities. They used a mix of bribery and bullying to normalize corruption.\n\nColumbus, Ohio: I've long felt that an prime but unspoken motivation for privatizing social security was to create coerced artificial demand for stocks, to the benefit of those who already owned them. Am I alone in this view?\n\nRobert H. Tillman: I think there's more than a little truth to your observation. Clearly Wall St and corporate American would have profited tremendously with the privatization of Social Security. It is truly amazing that the administration could have proposed this in the wake of massive corporate scandals in which investors were betrayed by the very people who would under privatization have access to more of their funds Hopefully, this proposal is dead and gone.\n\nMinneapolis, Minn.: The cases of Enron and Worldcom, among others, are classic examples of why government oversight is essential to protect investors. Do you see any real push by Congress and the SEC to strengthen the integrity of the Market beyond window dressing? Also, will this become an increasingly large concern as the Boomers retire and are even more dependent upon their portfolios for retirement income?\n\nMichael L. Indergaard: We see some substance and a whole lotta damage control. One thing that troubles us is that there has been little repudiation of the blind faith in markets that abetted the gutting of regulations. And there has been little, if any accountability for politicians who cashed in on positions of public trust.\n\nAnnapolis, Md.: I'm on Amazon concurrently with this post ordering your book.\n\nRecently, I was re-reading an old economics text book I have. It almost seems as if some of the basics (supply/demand curve analysis in particular) are changing as the markets become global in combination with rapid M&A activity plus this vertical and horizontal integration momentum.\n\nI get the impression we are in uncharted territory. From your perspective, how did the globalized economy emerge? Was it a result of random factors? Or were certain people/organizations responsible?\n\nMichael L. Indergaard: We stress the role of neoliberal ideologies and political mobilizations in weakening regulations during the 1990s. Certainly, these same forces have been vigorously promoting a certain type of globalization during the same period. Enron, for example, was at the forefront of promoting privatization of energy industries in developing countries and in exploiting such shifts. In this they were assisted by a host of U.S. government agencies and international bodies which provided Enron with something like $7 billion in support.\n\nWashington, D.C.: Are there any other techniques that corporate big-wigs use along with \"pump and dump\" to manipulate investors?\n\nRobert H. Tillman: Yes. The variations seem endless. One of the frauds that we explore in the book involved the outrageous rip-offs of electrical energy consumers in California in the late 1990s. These scams cost Californians an estimated $9 billion. Its useful to think about how many people could have been educated, housed or fed with that money. The most galling aspect of this was the fact that under deregulation, many of these practices were not illegal and very few of those responsible were ever punished.\n\nOutside of California, recent revelations about standard practices in the insurance industry also make one wonder if there's any area of the corporate world that is free from corruption.\n\nMunich, Germany: There's a fair amount of hype being published on the Internet by PR firms, trying to establish interest in a company stock, which is often deceptive, especially for small investors.\n\nWould you agree, that while the Internet has empowered small investors to a certain degree by providing access to previously unattainable information, the Internet has also become the domain of large organizations that are well versed in presenting potentially misleading information?\n\nMichael L. Indergaard: Nice to hear from Europa. I'm not sure that much of the info on the Internet is much more helpful than the many emails I get which want to give hot stock tips. The new economy, based as it is on network forms of organization, provides countless opportunities to hide information from investors. There are lots of unresolved issues about the Silicon Valley system which relies on insider ties. Their linkages with the financial system makes their privileged access to information, and ability to shape impressions, all the more problematic.\n\nArlington, Va.: Just curious -- what does \"neoliberal\" refer to ideologically? Does this mean \"third way\" Democrats?\n\nMichael L. Indergaard: It is because of the third-way Dems that one could state that the embrace of neoliberal ideas is bi-partisan. Members of Congress and Presidents from both parties have \"starring\" roles in our book's scrutiny of promiscous deregulation and free market ideologies. Thanks for bringing the issue up.\n\nArlington, Va.: Have there been any class action suits or complaints from investors about this practice? Or is it legal and allowed?\n\nRobert H. Tillman: If you're asking about the California energy scams, yes, there have been a number of class action suits, some of which have been successful and have recovered some money for the consumers. The problem is the difference between obtaining a judgement and obtaining cash from these companies. In order to get any money out of Enron California energy consumers will have to join a long line of people trying to get their hands on a dwindling pool of assets.\n\nArlington, Va.: The executives are not just inflating stock prices for their own greed, they are also helping lots of investors make money. I don't think Wall Street cares about high executive compensation packages, for example, as long as total shareholder return is high. The tragedy with an Enron or Worldcom is that the employees who couldn't dump the stocks were punished.\n\nMichael L. Indergaard: We argue that there were multiple motivations for those who participated in dubious or fraudulent actitivities. One of the basic examples of \"New Economy rules\" was the doctrine that a firm could become a first mover and dominate new markets if it turned its stock into a currency with which it could make acquistions. A lot of dot-com start-ups were playing the IPO game not to gain riches but to gain crediblity as New Economy players. In many cases, executives tried to play the New Economy game and then found themselves trapped. Then they engaged in fraudulent accounting or other ruses to try to keep things afloat.\n\nBethesda, Md.: As a small-investor what kind of protection can I take from mistrusting the wrong people? Because I still feel like I'm in the learning stages, I look towards those in the know for guidance. Am I just being naive?\n\nRobert H. Tillman: It's easy to be cynical in these situations--distrusting everybody. At the same time not all stocks are backed by phony information--indeed, most are perfectly honest and straightforward. But even trying to make prudent investment decisions under legitimate circumstances is difficult enough.\n\nthe only advice I can offer is to be careful not get caught up in the next wave of \"irrational exuberance\" or to be on the quest for \"the next big thing.\"\n\nNW DC: You used the term 'massive' to describe corporate scandals: Can you elaborate upon that?\n\nENRON and WorldCom were large companies, but they were an infinitesimal operator in a massive economy. What other evidence do you have that fraud was pervasive in business, rather than pervasive at an immaterial number of large organizations?\n\nRobert H. Tillman: Very good question. There is a tendency to see the whole barrel as rotten. We are now working on a more systematic study to try to arrive at some more precise estimates of the scope of corporate fraud, specifically, accounting fraud, and its costs.\n\nFor now, we can rely on a study by the GAO which found that between 1997 and 2002, over 800 public companies issued restatements of their financial conditions. This represented 10% of all companies listed on the major exchanges during that period. while this leaves 90% that did not file restatements, we think that 10% is a fairly large proportion.\n\nHopefully, we'll have a more precise answer in the future.\n\nWashington, DC: For the high-profile cases that we've heard about in the media (Enron, etc) aren't these the exceptions rather than the rules? There are millions of corporations in the U.S. and thousands of publicly traded companies... Are you asserting that these few bad apples are proof that the entire crop is spoiled?\n\nMichael L. Indergaard: Bob is answering a very similar question so I will address some big picture issues raised by your question. The magnitude of false finanical statements and of the frauds committed suggest a systemic problem. Our investigation of the politics behind deregulation--and the obstruction of regulators and reformers--speaks of issues that bridge the world of economics and politics. In the 1990s, the power of the corporate elite over Congress and regulators was such that they gained the ability to both make and break the rules. Some powerful executives and professionals have been held accountable by the courts but there has been little recognition of the flaws in our governance system that abetted their misdeeds. Ultimately, what is at stake is whehter we as democracy still have the ability to reflect critically on our system and correct it.\n\nMichael L. Indergaard: We'll conclude with the thoughts we ended our book's introduction with. \"Our study suggests that unregulated markets spur the formation of rogue entrepreneurs who feed on moral society--cashing in on social resources, such as relationships, reputation, and trust. 'Caveat emptor' is a sensible guideline in any era, but when it is the only norm that stands between ordinary investors and predatory insiders, \"buyer beware\" is the most rancid rule of all.\"\n\nEditor's Note: washingtonpost.com moderators retain editorial control over Live Online discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions. washingtonpost.com is not responsible for any content posted by third parties.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nIn their new book, \"Pump and Dump: The Rancid Rules of the New Economy,\" sociology professors Robert H.

Arsenal has been troubled by sub-standard goalkeeping over the past several seasons, but acquiring Cech from Chelsea should provide consistency in the back. The signing should significantly improve a glaring hole for the Gunners. Forecast: Arsenal has an outstanding group of attacking players, from Mesut Ozil to Alexis Sanchez to Santi Cazorla. But the unit hasn’t been able to pose a significant threat to the title yet. With Cech in the back finally offering some steady goalkeeping, this could be the year the Gunners put it all together for their first premiership title since 2003-04.\n\nASTON VILLA Manager: Tim Sherwood Last season: 17th Player to watch: Jordan Ayew. Aston Villa signed the 23-year-old Ghanaian national in July as a direct replacement for Christian Benteke (42 goals last three seasons), who departed for Liverpool. Ayew scored 12 goals for Lorient last season in France. Forecast: Aston Villa barely staved off relegation last year with a 17th-place finish, the latest in a string of disappointing campaigns for the Claret and Blue. And with Benteke gone, it doesn’t look like any major improvement is in order.\n\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE.\n\nManager: Eddie Howe Last season: Football League Championship winners (promoted) Player to watch: Callum Wilson. The 23-year-old scored 20 goals in League Championship play to lead Bournemouth to a title and a promotion to the Premiership. He’ll need to provide similar scoring production to help the club stay afloat in England’s top league. Forecast: Earning a promotion to the Premier League is one thing; staying there is exceedingly more challenging. Bournemouth will be making its first appearance in the Premier League, and while it will be a great story if the club can avoid relegation, don’t count on it.\n\nRELATED: NYCFC's FRANK LAMPARD TALKS PREMIER LEAGUE WITH DAILY NEWS\n\nCHELSEA Manager: Jose Mourinho Last season: Premier champ Player to watch: Eden Hazard. The Belgian midfielder was named Premier League Player of the Year in 2014-15 with 14 goals and nine assists in league play. It will be interesting to see how Hazard follows up that campaign. Forecast: The Blues are returning the entire starting 11 from their championship last season, and even brought in more talent with the addition of Colombian striker Radamel Falcao. With one of the sport’s best tacticians at the helm in Mourinho, it’s tough to pick against Chelsea to repeat.\n\nCRYSTAL PALACE Manager: Alan Pardew Last season: 10th Player to watch: Yohan Cabaye. In one of the surprise moves of the offseason, Crystal Palace paid a club-record fee in excess of $15 million to acquire Cabaye from Paris Saint-Germain. The 29-year-old French national is a proven commodity who formerly played for Newcastle United. Forecast: The move to bring in Cabaye is a clear sign that Crystal Palace and Pardew intend to improve on their top-half-of-the-table finish from last season. It would be no surprise if they continued to surge up the pecking order in 2015-16.\n\nManager: Roberto Martinez Last season: 11th Player to watch: Romelu Lukaku. The Belgian national had a slow start to last season, but still finished the campaign with 10 Premier League goals. Nonetheless, the club is seeking a more consistent performance from the striker this season. Forecast: It’s hard to say 2014-15 was anything but a disappointment for Everton after the team had qualified for the Europa League a year earlier with a fifth-place finish. They dropped to 11th in 2014-15 and even admitted at one point to being in the relegation battle. As of now, it looks like they’ll hang on to talented defender John Stones — an important piece if Everton hopes to return to its previous form this season.\n\nLEICESTER CITY Manager: Claudio Ranieri Last season: 14th Player to watch: Jamie Vardy. The 28-year-old striker scored five Premier League goals last season, playing his best soccer at the end of the season to help the Foxes avoid relegation. He scored winning goals in crucial victories over West Brom and Burnley in April en route to winning Premier League Player of the Month honors. That form points to a potential breakout campaign for the English national. Forecast: Leicester proved down the stretch last season that it could win consistently at home in King Power Stadium. Still, expect the Foxes and Ranieri to be in another heated relegation battle come April.\n\nLIVERPOOL Manager: Brendan Rodgers Last season: 6th Player to watch: Christian Benteke. Lack of production from the striker position hampered Liverpool after the departure of Luis Suarez in the offseason. Benteke is a proven Premier League goal scorer who’s netted 23, 11 and 15 goals in his past three seasons at Aston Villa. He’s going to need to post big numbers to help the Reds overcome last season’s disappointment. Forecast: Liverpool lost the incredibly talented Raheem Sterling to Manchester City during the transfer window, but made a considerable effort to replace his presence in the midfield with a number of signings, including Brazilian Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim (Germany) and James Milner from City. Rodgers will have to earn results, or he could be on his way out.\n\nMANCHESTER CITY Manager: Manuel Pellegrini Last season: 2nd Player to watch: Raheem Sterling. All eyes will be on the young midfielder as he tries to live up to the massive $50-million-plus deal he earned in the transfer window. He certainly has the talent to be one of the most dynamic playmakers in England. Forecast: After an apparent letdown in 2014-15 in the wake of a championship campaign the year before, Manchester City should legitimately challenge Chelsea for the title this season. Whether Man City does will rest largely on whether top players like Samir Nasri, Yaya Toure and Pablo Zabaleta can return to elite form.\n\nMANCHESTER UNITED Manager: Louis van Gaal Last season: 4th Player to watch: Bastian Schweinsteiger (below). The 31-year-old German national may not be the dominant player he was during his prime with Bayern Munich, but he will still bring much-needed physicality to the Manchester United midfield. Expect Schweinsteiger to be a commanding presence as the Red Devils make a push for the title. Forecast: United rebounded from a disappointing seventh-place finish in 2013-14 to earn a spot in the Champions League for this upcoming season. But that won’t be enough for van Gaal, who wants to bring a championship back to Manchester. On top of Schweinsteiger, United also added Dutch winger Memphis Depay, who could be a breakout performer with strikers Robin van Persie and Falcao having left.\n\nNEWCASTLE UNITED Manager: Steve McClaren Last season: 15th Player to watch: Georginio Wijnaldum. The 24-year-old Dutch midfielder was Newcastle’s biggest addition of the offseason and will be crucial if the club hopes to improve on its near-relegation season in 2014-15. Wijnaldum led PSV Eindhoven of the Netherlands to its first title since 2008 last season. Forecast: Newcastle drastically underperformed under John Carver in 2014-15, and there are hopes for a turnaround in 2015-16 under McClaren. Expectations have been set high for the new season, as McClaren has been tasked with at least an eighth-place finish and a cup competition win, according to club managing director Lee Charnley.\n\nNORWICH CITY Manager: Alex Neil Last season: Promoted from Football League Championship. Player to watch: Cameron Jerome. The English striker has bounced around during his 12-year career, appearing in the Premier League for three teams in six seasons. He’ll get another opportunity in England’s top flight after scoring a team-high 20 goals for Norwich in the League Championship last season. Forecast: The Canaries are back in the Premier League after a one-year absence. The club will almost certainly be involved in another relegation fight unless it can drastically exceed expectations.\n\nSOUTHAMPTON Manager: Ronald Koeman Last season: 7th Player to watch: Graziano Pelle. The brawny Italian striker led the club with 12 league goals last season, and he’ll need to provide similar production if Southampton hopes to remain in the top half of the table in 2015-16. Forecast: In typical Southampton fashion, a number of crucial pieces transferred in the offseason after a surprisingly successful campaign, as right back Nathaniel Clyne left for Liverpool and midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin for Manchester United. The Saints brought in Dutch midfielder Jordy Clasie to replace Schnederlin.\n\nSTOKE CITY Manager: Mark Hughes Last season: 9th Player to watch: Ibrahim Afellay. The former Barcelona winger and Dutch national is expected to be one of the most impactful and exciting additions in the Premier League this season. He scored six goals while on loan with Olympiacos last season in Greece. Forecast: The Potters are fresh off their best Premier League finish, and they’re looking to improve. A top-six finish and European qualification is their stated goal, though that may be a reach. Goalkeeper Jack Butland, 22, will have to step in and prove himself with Asmir Begovic leaving for Chelsea.\n\nSUNDERLAND Manager: Dick Advocaat Last season: 16th Player to watch: Steven Fletcher. The 28-year-old Scottish national tied with Connor Wickham to lead the club with five league goals last season. Wickham transferred to Crystal Palace in the offseason, so Fletcher will need to step up to fill the void. Forecast: Even if Fletcher accounts for some of Wickham’s lost scoring, Sunderland will still be in desperate need of another attacker. Advocaat came in last season for the final nine games to miraculously help the club avoid relegation. It should be in a similar position this season.\n\nSWANSEA CITY Manager: Garry Monk Last season: 8th Player to watch: Gylfi Sigurdsson. The 25-year-old Icelandic national with a sublime long-range shot was an integral part of Swansea’s top-half finish last season, scoring seven goals in 32 appearances. He’s going to continue to be the centerpiece of Monk’s squad in 2015-16. Forecast: The club made a couple of key additions in Eder from Portugal and Ghanaian international Andre Ayew to add depth. Barring an unexpected turn of events, Swansea should hover around mid-table as they have for the past four seasons.\n\nTOTTENHAM HOTSPUR Manager: Mauricio Pochettino Last season: 5th Player to watch: Harry Kane. In his second full season with Tottenham, Kane emerged as one of the elite goal scorers in the Premier League and one of the best English players the country has to offer. The 22-year-old put away 21 goals in league play in 2014-15 — and scored 31 in total — good enough for second in the premiership. It could just be the beginning for Kane. Forecast: The Spurs turned it on late last season to claim a fifth-place finish and qualify for the Europa for the second straight season. But even if Kane electrifies again in 2015-16, it’s tough to see Tottenham sneaking into the top-four to earn a Champions League bid. Man U, Man City, Arsenal and Chelsea seemed to have those spots locked up.\n\nWATFORD Manager: Quique Flores Last season: Football League Championship runners-up (promoted) Player to watch: Troy Deeney. The 27-year-old former Aston Villa youth player is part of a trio of Watford forwards who totaled 57 league goals last season. Deeney, the captain, led the club with 21. Odion Ighalo scored 20, while Matej Vydra scored 16. Forecast: The Hornets were promoted to the Premier League for the first time since 2006-07, after eight seasons laboring in the Championship. But much like with promotion pals Norwich City and Bournemouth, avoiding relegation will be tough.\n\nWEST BROMWICH ALBION Manager: Tony Pulis Last season: 13th Player to watch: Saido Berahino. The 22-year-old striker took a major step forward last season, scoring 14 goals in his second full year in the Premier League. Even more production could be in store for 2015-16. Forecast: West Brom needs Berahino to replicate his 2014-15 season if it is going to avoid a relegation fight. The club signed former Liverpool and Southampton man Rickie Lambert in the offseason and hopes he can complement the young striker. Lambert, though, found the back of the net just twice in 25 appearances last season.\n\nWEST HAM UNITED Manager: Slaven Bilic Last season: 12th Player to watch: Dimitri Payet. The 28-year-old French international has exquisite playmaking ability and will be a huge addition for West Ham. He had eight goals and 21 assists for Marseille in France. Forecast: With an exciting attacking trio of Payet, Enner Valencia and Mauro Zarate, West Ham has the talent to improve on last season’s bottom-half finish. Andy Carroll, who was third on the team with five league goals last season, will start the season injured. His return to form will be important.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nARSENAL Manager: Arsene Wenger Last season: 3rd Player to watch: Petr Cech.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00000-of-00064--439", "original_text": "“If I close my eyes,” Jennifer Hudson says, closing her eyes, “I can almost remember what it was like, what I was like, 15 years ago. I was at home in Chicago, still in high school, singing in church, living with my family.” She opens her bright brown eyes again, stares straight at me to answer my question. “But generally, no, it feels like another Jennifer life. I don’t look the same. I’m a mother now. So many things have changed. I sometimes think the only constant is my voice. That hasn’t gone away.”\n\nIn those 15 years, Hudson has lived more than a few American dreams and nightmares. Having taken her chances at manufactured fame on Simon Cowell’s American Idol (she was a losing finalist in series 3) she discovered it for real with her unforgettable debut acting performance in Dreamgirls, in which she played spurned Motown diva Effie White, stealing the show from Beyoncé Knowles, Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx and winning a best supporting actress Oscar. She followed that with a Grammy award-winning album that saw her bracketed, naturally, with Aretha and Whitney. The talk then was that she had an old soul voice, a seen-it-all voice (the authentic sound of a “religious, transcendent experience” Oprah Winfrey said). As it turned out, she hadn’t seen anything yet.\n\nIn October 2008, while on tour, Hudson received a call from her sister Julia that changed the narrative of her life forever. Hudson had been trying to reach her mother by text that morning and was worried that she did not get a reply (they contacted each other first thing every morning when she was on the road, so the silence was odd). The silence was explained by Julia’s hysterical call that told her their mother, Darnell, and brother, Jason, had been shot and murdered at home, and that Julia’s seven-year-old son, Julian, was missing.\n\nHudson later recalled in the trial of her former brother-in-law, William Balfour, that she had gone straight back to Chicago and holed up with her sister in a hotel room, holding each other and waiting for news. After three days, Julian’s body was discovered in the back of a stolen pick-up truck. Balfour was eventually convicted of the three murders in 2012 and received three life sentences.\n\nHudson is still finding ways to talk about those years. “I have definitely seen the highest of the highs and the lowest of the lows,” she says. “You don’t know how strong you are until you are placed in that kind of moment.” She pauses. “I don’t really know what else to say.”\n\nHer mother had been the secretary of the local church, where Hudson had led the gospel solos in the choir. Was her religious faith a help to her? “It was the ultimate help to me,” she says. “We always said: ‘If He brings you to it, He will bring you through it.’ There would be no point in faith if it wasn’t tested. My mother always told me no matter how negative your life seems to be, you must always look for a positive. That is what I believe a woman of faith should do.”\n\nIn hudson’s early years her father was mostly absent from the family and she shared a bed with her mother until she was 16. There is a kind of primal scream of human separation that her voice seems created for. It was there already in her extraordinary performance of Dreamgirls’s signature lament – “And I am telling you I’m not going” – and it is there throughout her second album, on tracks like “I Remember Me”. Her third album, JHUD, which is released in September, includes a song that she has written in her mother’s memory called “Moan”. The lyric runs: “My momma taught me everything I know, and I will take it everywhere I go, if you think you’ve seen it all, just keep on living, live long”.\n\nI imagine the act of singing that song has been very tough. “Yes,” she says, “but Mom would always tell us if you are hurting, moan and you will feel better. That’s the title of the song. There is not a day that goes by when I don’t repeat the things she said. She was very quiet. The complete opposite of us kids. Now she has gone, I realise she had a lot to say. My brother, too, I hear him, too. When we were kids any time my brother saw me crying he would be like, ‘Jenny, knock it off.’ And that’s what I hear him say when I cry now.”\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, Hudson was in something of a daze. She was in something like that state, too, she recalls, when she walked out at the Super Bowl in 2012 to sing “Star-Spangled Banner” beside the children of Sandy Hook High School who had lately suffered their own immeasurable loss. The performance came a few weeks after the long process of justice that culminated in the conviction of Balfour.\n\n“In many ways the trial was the most dreadful part of it all,” Hudson says. “But again I know my mother would not have wanted us to miss a beat, so we were there every day. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone to have to experience anything like that, but that is what you do for your family, so that is what we did…”\n\nWhat was in her head when she stepped out to sing the national anthem? “I was not very present at all any of that time,” she says. “It felt like a dream. I haven’t watched it back, because those moments send you back to a certain place and that’s a place I don’t want to go back to.”\n\nTo avoid that constant return to grief, Hudson has worked on ways to live in the present and future. “That is where the Julian D King Foundation came from,” she says, of the charity created in her nephew’s name. “I was thinking how could I find something in all this that would make my mother proud of me. My sister and I lost three family members and we both wanted to find a way that we would not dread every birthday and holiday and family occasion again. I wanted my sister to celebrate Julian’s birthday again, so we created Hatch Day, where we go around together giving local schools supplies that they need. And she looks forward to shopping for that, like she used to look forward to shopping for his birthday presents. My nephew was super into education – he used to call himself Dr King. She can pour his blessings on to these kids and keep his memory alive.”\n\nIt is often said of great soul singers that all the grief of the ages is embedded in their voices; have those awful experiences, I ask, changed the way she feels about her own vocal expression? She thinks for a moment. “No,” she says. “Certainly there is a lot of emotion there, but I think I have always been in that kind of space. What do they say in church? Sing from your heart, because you are singing to God. You know, when I used to sing those solos in church I would go through every line and ask the director: ‘What does this mean? What are we trying to convey here?’ If you can’t feel the emotion of a song, how do you expect anyone else to? It’s like a testimony in that way.”\n\nShe believes that testimony has become more personal on her new album, which is more upbeat than her previous ballad-led work. “I think this album is more my personality coming through,” she says. She has been writing on some of the tracks and is involved in production, with the help of friends like Timbaland and R Kelly.\n\n“It’s been a completely different experience,” she says. “I’ve never stayed in the studio all night long, but this time I had a three-song set to do with Timbaland and we did all three songs in one night. I was writing, guiding my own vocals, just being creative. I never used to love going into the studio. Now I can’t wait to get there.”\n\nWriting is a new challenge, but the gift of singing has been with her as long as she can remember. When did she first realise she could communicate it?\n\n“When I was 13, 14. It was my other classmates or people in the choir who kind of made me realise,” she says. “They would say the adults listened differently when I sang. And that made me take notice. I started to go and sing at various places and all these people would show up – my teachers, people from church, friends. After that I would be making music videos in the mirror, practising my acceptance speeches. I would sing in the hallway of our home, where the acoustics were good, and neighbours would stop me next morning and say: ‘I heard you singing last night.’ The line was always the same: ‘She’s a little girl but she sounds like a grown woman…’”\n\nThere had been a lot of music at home. Her grandmother, who lived with the family, had been a soloist in her time, and taught Jennifer and Julia (“though my sister is not a singer,” Hudson says of her elder sibling, with a rivalrous giggle. “Not at all! She’s hilarious!”)\n\nIt was her mother who pointed her in the direction of American Idol. “The first series, I wasn’t so interested. It was summer, I wanted to be outside. But my mother was on at me: ‘You should watch this.’ To start with I was like, ‘Whatever’, but when Kelly Clarkson won the first series I was literally nauseous. I realised it could be for real. I was beating myself up that I didn’t go and audition. When season two came around I had started working for the Disney Cruise Line and that was a given, whereas Idol was a gamble. So I stuck with what I had. I used the ship experience to test myself. When I got off the ship two days later I went to audition for American Idol. That’s when the ball started rolling.”\n\nShe must have been surprised not to win.\n\n“It was better to lose, in some ways. When I went to audition for Dreamgirls, I was still in that ‘I am not going to let anything stop me’ kind of mood.”\n\nWas it terrifying to turn up on the first day on set with Foxx and Murphy and Beyoncé, without a day’s acting experience?\n\n“It was like I had blinders on. I had no time to be scared. I didn’t really realise how important my character, Effie, was to the film until it finished, somehow. I just wanted to keep up, make sure I did my best.”\n\nThat spirit seems to have been pretty near to the surface throughout Hudson’s life. There is something cheerfully indomitable about her, something you guess will never take no for an answer, and not just because you know what she has come through. When I ask her about her father she says that he wasn’t really present in her childhood, but when she was 14 she thought “enough was enough and went with my siblings to find him. And after that he was around for us until he passed. I was always one for having people get along. So I was a bit like: ‘Let’s go and get Dad and tell him we are all going to live together’ and after that we did. It was kind of weird.”\n\nIn 2010 Hudson dramatically changed her appearance, losing 4st and becoming a face of Weight Watchers. I ask if that change in body shape has further changed her sense of self. “I have a lot more fun with clothes and shopping these days,” she says. “But as far as sense of self I have always had a lot of confidence. There were several reasons for it. One was preparing for an acting role. The other was that my fiancé [WWE wrestler-turned-lawyer David Otunga] and I realised that when we were growing up neither one of us had good health examples. We were always told to finish your food, clear your plate. We were never taught the proper way to eat. We grew up around a lot of eating, fish fries on Fridays, all that. When I was ready to have my son we wanted to teach him right. It was not until I went to Hollywood that I realised people might watch what they eat. I was like, ‘Wow!’ And then I thought ‘OK, I can do that.’”\n\nHave people treated her differently?\n\n“Definitely. People I knew 10 years ago, 50lb ago, will be really strange around me. I have to remind them it is me, Jennifer, honestly.”\n\nThe birth of Hudson’s son, David Jnr, in 2009, followed quite closely on the tragedy and presented her with a new set of challenges, as well as an ever-present antidote to her grief. She has travelled to London alone when we meet but hates to be away from him.\n\n“He’s nearly five, a big boy now at home with his dad. He will click his fingers when I leave and say, ‘Mum you will be home this quick?’ He’s into superheroes, so I tell him I’m going to fly away like Superman and do my work and fly right back to him. Which works for a while…”\n\nOne of the things her experience of being a daughter and mother have taught her is that maybe there are more things to sing about than the songs that tend to come her way. She once expressed her regret, at 30-something, about still being expected to sing exclusively about clubland chemistry. I wonder how strongly she feels that. “Something I said got a bit exaggerated,” she says, “but there are an awful lot of songs about sex, and it’s more like, as I say to my sister Julia sometimes, does everything have to be about that one thing? The world is a broad place. Even on my first album I was like, ‘Isn’t there more to sing about in the world? Or to talk about? There is so much more out there to portray…’”\n\nAs she talks, she uses her sister, with whom she has been through so much, as a kind of touchstone, or ever-present confidante. “We have always been very close,” she says. “She works with me now – although she doesn’t do all that much work! She bosses me around, she’s a tough cookie. We don’t live together or anything, she likes being Julia and I like being Jennifer, but she never stops being my big sister. It’s like, ‘Jennifer go get this!’ and I’m like, ‘Hey, I’m the boss!’”\n\nThat mixture of tenderness and stubborn will seems ever present in Hudson’s voice. When she was making JHUD her more assertive alter ego was christened with a name – Jones – the part of her that, however broken or vulnerable, is always ready to take on the world. Where, I ask, before our time is up, did that moniker come from?\n\n“It came from doing the shoot for the album,” she says. “The image was coming together photo by photo, but I’d look at it and think: ‘Who is that? It’s not me!’ It took on a whole other persona. It looked more like Grace Jones. Since then I call her Jones, ‘boss lady’, she’s always around.” Hudson laughs. “I don’t think she’s going away any time soon.”\n\nJennifer Hudson’s latest single, Walk It Out, is out now. The new album is released later this year", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\n“If I close my eyes,” Jennifer Hudson says, closing her eyes, “I can almost remember what it was like, what I was like, 15 years ago. I was at home in Chicago, still in high school, singing in church, living with my family.” She opens her bright brown eyes again, star"}

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00002-of-00064--419", "original_text": "Donald Trump is not a great promoter. He has explained that to me a number of times already. “See, I don’t view myself as a good promoter,” he said during a five-hour flight from New York to Los Angeles on his private 727. “People say I’m a great promoter. People say I’m the greatest promoter that there is. Anywhere.”\n\nSo when we meet the next morning in the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel, it’s a relief to see that he’s working through his promotional problems: On his head is a red baseball cap bearing the coat of arms Trump created for himself (a hand clutching an arrow, resting on a knight’s helmet, which is perched over three leaping lions) and, emblazoned in gold, TRUMP INTERNATIONAL, the name of his Florida golf course. His yellow Tommy Hilfiger sweatshirt also sports the insignia, as does the white golf shirt underneath. Only his khakis are logo-free, along with his golf cleats—which he will wear all day without actually golfing.\n\nWhat Donald Trump is great at, Donald Trump tells me, is building buildings, inside and out. And today he’s focusing on the minute details of the inside, climbing into a limo for a trip to the factory of J.P. Weaver Co., which makes, he says, “the most incredible moldings you’ll ever see.” Trump is adding a 17,000-square-foot ballroom to his Palm Beach private club, Mar-a-Lago, a 128-room mansion built in 1927 from Dorian stone imported from Italy and containing 36,000 Spanish tiles dating back to the 15th century. And as soon as he walks into the company’s showroom, designed to resemble a room at Versailles, he has seen enough.\n\nFor more on Donald Trump, watch this video:\n\n“This is exactly what I’m looking for,” he says to owner Lenna Tyler-Kast, his plastic cleats clicking along the hand-laid cherry floor. The room is a riot of celadon moldings—flowers in urns, flowers on their own, curlicues, leaves, tasseled ropes, ribbons. “Not the ceiling, by the way,” Trump warns. “The ceiling no, the walls yes. I also think the mirrors should have this.” He fingers a delicate strip of molding that splits a mirror into a grid. “The moldings are very important in the mirror.” A few minutes later, as Tyler-Kast handles other business, Trump marvels at what he’s seen. “Unbelievable,” he says in a low whisper. “Can you imagine if I can pull that off in a huge room?” As soon as she comes back, though, the famously pursed lips return. “What’s your price? I hope that you’ll give me a discount. No. 1, because I’m Trump.”\n\nThis is business done the Donald Trump way. Don’t believe what you see on TV—watching him work is actually much more entertaining. In Trump’s reality show, The Apprentice, he and two lieutenants monitor contestants as they backstab their way to a $250,000-a-year job as president of one of his companies. In Trump’s real life he has managed—by force of personality, insane attention to certain details, charisma, bluntness, self-promotion, and connections—to build an empire of steel, marble, beauty pageants, casinos, and some of the most incredible moldings you’ll ever see. The total value? If you believe Trump, $6 billion.\n\nBut few people actually believe him. And there’s good reason. Trump is the Reality Tycoon. He lives his life straight out of the Survivor handbook: Start with the truth, then add enough drama, celebrity, sex, and what might very charitably be called creative editing to make something entirely outlandish. What The Bachelor is to dating and American Idol is to singing in the shower, Trump is to business. He dabbles in the world of management and money as we know it: working through deals, meeting with lawyers, phoning underlings to gauge how his enterprises are doing. But then he’s off into the Trumposphere, jumping into his 727—a plane with so much mirrored gold in the bathrooms that it may be the cause of his ever-present squint—for a run to the coast to be feted by Hollywood, or to Florida to visit his golf course for a round of speed golf. If he’s not flying, he’s engaging in acts that people who don’t even want to like business like hearing about: writing bestselling management books, toying with a run for President, showing up at parties with his stunning Slovenian girlfriend, Melania Knauss, filming commercials for McDonald’s mcd or Verizon vz , or appearing on Saturday Night Live. All the while the casino company of which he is chairman and CEO is crumbling beneath him—something that might keep a different kind of executive awake at night—but Trump is breezily unfazed.\n\nIn a few minutes of talking, Trump sprinkles in enough superlatives to make the Guinness Book of World Records read like a list of deeds and transfers. “I build the best buildings in the best locations,” he says. His girlfriend is the “most efficient person I’ve ever met.” (Though Trump soon after notes that he himself is “very efficient.” In fact, he’s the “most efficient human being.”) The 18th hole of his golf course outside Los Angeles, rebuilt after it slid into the Pacific Ocean, is now the “safest place in California if there’s an earthquake. Literally.” When FORTUNE wrote an article recently about the booming stocks of housing companies, he called to remind me that he is the “ultimate homebuilder.” “I don’t think of myself that way,” he says. “But really, I guess I am.”\n\nIn his private 727, Trump and girlfriend Melania Knauss travel in gilded style.Martin Schoeller — Corbis\n\nSometimes Trump’s boasts even turn out to be loosely truth-based. Trump, for instance, called me in mid-March to announce that following negotiations with NBC, he was “officially the highest-paid person on television.” A top executive at NBC would only say, “Consider your source.” And Trump’s co-producer on The Apprentice, reality TV impresario Mark Burnett, denied Trump’s claim altogether. Trump called Burnett as we were talking, and ten minutes later Burnett called me back to explain that, well, if you look only at prime time, and after Friends goes off the air, and once the next season of The Apprentice starts, then, yes, Trump is probably correct. Trump later explained that that’s what he really meant.\n\nOf course, it’s not just Trump who thinks he’s the hottest thing going. According to a stack of papers and personal letters he handed to me, Suburban Golf, an occasional insert in the suburban New York—based Journal News, thinks Trump National Golf Club is better than Winged Foot. “This is a Gannett paper,” he says. “That’s the whole deal. That’s the monopoly up in Westchester.” Real Estate Weekly heralds him as a “realty TV star.” And while he has nothing but disdain for the New York Times’s coverage of him, he still keeps an inch-thick stack of color copies of the paper’s positive 2002 architectural review of Trump World Tower. Even gossip columnists, who regularly take Trump to task for his unusual hairdo, make a point of boosting him—whether they mean to do so publicly or not. In mid-March syndicated columnist Liz Smith wrote Trump a private letter in which she declared that she was fighting to get the New York Landmarks Conservancy to declare him one of its “Living Landmarks.” If anyone found out, she warned, she’d have to resign from the conservancy, noting in her P.S., “I hate to ask you not to circulate this, but I am asking. I think you understand.” Trump handed me the letter and told me to keep it.\n\nWhat Trump definitely understands is that all of these boasts and declarations, whether coming from him directly or indirectly, serve more than just to get the world to catch up to his image of himself. There’s real business involved. Love him or hate him, Trump’s self-promotion works. He’s managed to create a nationally known luxury real estate brand. Neil Ostergren, former president of the Hospitality Sales and Marketing Association and now a consultant, has polled some 800 senior executives since 1997 to see what names they know in real estate. The only two that scored consistently high: Trump and Levitt. And what William Levitt’s Levittown did for middle-income housing, Trump seems to be pulling off for the rich. Condos in Trump-branded buildings so far this year sold for 39% above New York’s $853-per-square-foot average. In Chicago, Trump and the troubled newspaper company Hollinger International are planning a 90-story condo tower downtown, to be called, surprisingly, Trump International Hotel & Tower. Even though the building still on the site has yet to be razed, Trump has managed to sell so many units at such high prices—from $575,000 to $15 million—that he single-handedly raised the average condo price for the entire city by 25% at the end of last year. “He’s like P.T. Barnum on steroids,” says Richard LeFrak, a New York real estate developer and a friend of Trump’s. “What’s his greatest asset? It’s his name. He’s a skillful marketing person, and what he markets is his name.”\n\nRead More: Donald Trump Just Got More Bad News in His Trump University Trial\n\nThe name earns him more than just condo fees. The self-promotion and the larger-than-life persona earn him deals that other real estate developers never see, allow him to get financing where most would have long been cut off, and win him friends among people who are prepared to be his enemies. Now, with The Apprentice becoming, says Trump, the “hottest show on television” (er, No. 7, but definitely doing well enough to save NBC’s soon-to-be-Friend-less lineup), his brand is even bigger than it was during the last Donald peak, in the late 1980s. And while Trump likes doing the show, what he really likes doing is real estate. “I keep telling people, NBC pays me a lot of money, a lot of money, but American Express”—which rents space in 40 Wall Street, a building on which Trump holds a 250-year lease—”pays me more every week.” Not that the show and real estate don’t work well together. While in Los Angeles, Trump filmed a comedy spot for the Jay Leno show. Before shooting, NBC Entertainment president Jeff Zucker stopped by, and the two almost immediately started to talk about apartments in Manhattan, with Trump pressing on him a place in Trump International. “He’s going to buy,” Trump said later. (Zucker insists Trump’s kidding.)\n\nThe Trump show—the real-life one—has been playing for decades, and rivals and peers marvel at his ability to keep at it. “He can sell anything to anyone, he really can,” says Percy Pyne, CEO of Pyne Co. and a real estate investor who has dealt with Trump for 25 years. “He’s a magician.”\n\nOf course, no magician worth his salt reveals his secrets, and Trump is no different. Is he worth the billions that he says he is? Or is it more like a few hundred million, as several ex-associates say? Outsiders have never gotten to the bottom of his finances, despite his near bankruptcy in the early 1990s, and weeks of digging by FORTUNE yielded only murk. All his deals are buried in layers of corporate names, partners, and either debt or no debt, depending on whether you’re talking to Trump. Not that it matters. The more interesting question is not what he owns but how he gets it. And what the heck is it like to work for a man who never turns off? The simple answer to that last question, says Greg Cuneo, chairman of New York construction heavyweight HRH and a man who got his start thanks to Trump, is this: “Bizarre. Totally fucking bizarre.” And he means it glowingly.\n\nDonald Trump can seem at times like a caricature of himself, and yet he’s strangely appealing. He has a warm side—on the flight he cooed over Knauss’s sore throat—and a politician’s knack for making it seem as if he’s telling you something for the first time he’s said many times before. Even his constant, casual mentions of how much he makes, how much the things he owns cost, and how much he has in the bank are somehow refreshing. He’s not embarrassed about making money or spending it. And the best way to understand how Trump makes it is to see how he lost it.\n\nIn the 1980s, Trump, the son of an extremely successful outer-borough New York developer, funded a world of buildings, hotels, and casinos, a USFL football team (helmed by Doug Flutie), a 284-foot yacht (helmed on the comic pages by Doonesbury character Duke), and an airline, mainly by charming banks into huge mortgages—even persuading them to lend him money for his equity stake, backed only by personal guarantees. When the early 1990s recession hit, Trump began to default on his loans and found himself with nearly $1 billion in debt that he personally had guaranteed. He worked out a deal with the banks to sell his properties and get them some of their money back. In return, they spared him from having to declare personal bankruptcy. Reports at the time said the banks granted Trump a $450,000 monthly allowance. He denies it. “Honestly, wouldn’t that be terrible PR for the banks?” Trump says.\n\nOver the next few years Trump clawed his way back, negotiating with contractors who had liens on his property, bringing in professional management, doing smaller deals, and releveraging the casinos. It was that last action that freed him from the banks. In 1995 he took public a couple of casinos then loaded with about $500 million in debt, calling the company Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts and giving it for a ticker symbol his monogram, DJT (the “J” stands for John). Then he added even more debt, using the public company to buy two of his other deeply leveraged casinos, Trump Taj Mahal and Trump’s Castle. By the end of 1996, DJT the company was carrying $1.7 billion in debt.\n\nPeople pass the boardwalk entrance to the Trump taj mahal casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on Saturday, February 28, 2004.Emile Wamsteker — Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWith the cash and refinancing, DJT the man mollified the banks. But he also infuriated shareholders. Today the casino company hands over 20% of its net revenue in interest payments. But Trump, a master at moving the chess pieces of his empire around to support the others, has no qualms. “Entrepreneurially speaking, not necessarily from the standpoint of running a company but from an entrepreneur’s standpoint, [the IPO] was one of the great deals,” he says. His days as CEO are likely numbered (see box).\n\nRead More: What Does Donald Trump Really Want?\n\nAfter doing his casino deals, Trump turned back to real estate. To build Trump Place, a series of rental and condo properties along a nearly mile-long swath of land he owned on Manhattan’s West Side, he found six Chinese companies willing to foot the bill. To win them over, he flew to Hong Kong and met with Vincent Lo, chairman and CEO of Hong Kong’s mammoth Shui On Holdings, and other investors. During a game of golf, the two sides worked out a deal—the Chinese would put up all the money, and Trump would get management fees, plus a big bonus when major parcels were complete and after the investors got their money back plus a preferred return. Lo was stunned by his speed and oversized personality. “We don’t have anyone like him here, that’s for sure,” laughs Lo, who, when he comes to the U.S. to visit the property, makes a point of playing a round at Trump National Golf Course in Westchester, N.Y., where he’s an honorary member.\n\nBack in the U.S., there are plenty of people who will do deals just to get close to Trump. In 1998 he called up Steve Hilbert, the flamboyant founder and CEO of insurance and financial services firm Conseco, and persuaded him to put up most of the money—$191 million to Trump’s $11 million—to be a fifty-fifty partner in purchasing New York’s GM Building gm , best known to tourists for housing the F.A.O. Schwarz flagship store. Conseco had little experience with real estate deals this big, and Hilbert had met Trump only once, yet the two quickly worked out a deal. “Trump is a very good negotiator. He basically says, ‘You don’t know anything about New York real estate, I’m the king of New York real estate, I want to run this thing,'” says a person with detailed knowledge of Conseco and the deal. And Trump knew who he was dealing with: Hilbert was based in Indianapolis, the same city as the GM Building’s owners, and he was always looking for big scores. “He was a Donald Trump wannabe,” says the source. “He was very enamored of Trump.” (Says Hilbert: “This was the right structure, the right operating partner in Donald, and we had all the controls we needed.”)\n\nLater that same year Trump persuaded the massive Korean chaebol Daewoo—which later sank under the weight of its debt—to put up almost all of the money to build the $360 million Trump World Tower, a 72-story condo complex across the street from the United Nations building in New York. There were plenty of bidders for the site, but Trump knew that Daewoo, with its size and engineering focus, would be attractive to the landowner, the United Engineering Foundation. And again, Trump let Daewoo executives know they couldn’t pull off anything in New York without him.\n\nThe Trump World Tower in Manhattan.Philip Greenberg\n\nIn each case Trump used Trump to get ahead. Just ask him. “One of the advantages I have by being a superstar is that when I call people, no matter who they are, they’re honored to be my partner. And I’ve done a great job,” he says, of no particular deal. “If some other competitor of mine in New York, you know, Mr. Irving Schwartz of Schwartz Co.—nice builder, everything good—calls you, you’d say, ‘Give me a break.’ When Donald Trump calls, you say, ‘Oh, great!’ I get to the top guy immediately. And if he’s not in, they call me back in five minutes.”\n\nBut once the call gets picked up, self-promotion doesn’t always lead to riches. In the case of the GM Building, Conseco agreed to Trump’s insistent demand for 50% ownership, but only if it got in exchange a 15% preferred return on its money in a sale. When Hilbert’s dealmaking sent Conseco into a free fall, Trump had his chance at the whole building but had trouble putting together a package. Conseco rejected a $295 million debt-and-equity deal Trump constructed with Deutsche Bank, saying it was too wobbly. Then Sept. 11 hit, Trump missed his deadline for getting a deal approved by Conseco, and the two ended up in years of litigation. (Interestingly, Hilbert, after being pushed out of Conseco, testified on Trump’s side.) An arbitration panel last year ruled that Trump not only wouldn’t get the building but also had to sell his half to Conseco for $15.6 million. Before the case went to appeal, the two parties settled for an undisclosed amount that, according to sources unfriendly to Trump, is more than $20 million but not much more. (Trump would say only that the figure is “totally wrong, absolutely wrong.”) If true, that’s not a bad return, but not nearly what Trump could have gotten. Trump had spent two years, by all accounts, masterfully fixing up the building—installing a new marble lobby, redoing the front plaza, raising rents, tacking up four-foot brass letters reading TRUMP on the front and back. And thanks largely to his efforts, Conseco sold the GM Building for $1.4 billion—a number that Trump could, if he wanted, honestly brag is the highest price ever paid per square foot for an office building.\n\nIn Trump’s eyes, the problem was personal. The new management of Conseco didn’t care how much he had transformed the building. “They were at war with Steve Hilbert,” he says. “And with me, because Steve was the person who made the deal with me, even though I didn’t know him before this deal.” Still, he says he’s proud of what he pulled off: “Look, very simply, I got control of a very major building in New York for almost no investment. Not so bad.”\n\nIn the first episode of The Apprentice, Donald Trump climbs out of a limo on Manhattan’s West Side and announces to the camera what the contestants are battling for. “This is the chance to work for me at a huuuuge salary,” he says, his hair not whipping in the wind. “And more importantly to learn enough so that maybe they too can be a billionaire some day.”\n\nOn a recent day at work, he shows how it’s done:\n\n“Vince, this is Donald Trump,” says Trump, leaning into a speakerphone in his office, which is decorated with gold-framed pictures of himself from magazine covers. He’s haggling with a contractor over the cost of fire doors for a new building at Trump Place. He’s dressed in a suit and a bright-pink tie, and his feet are kicked behind him as if he were riding a motorcycle. Sitting in front of Trump is a group of men from the general contracting firm in charge of the building—the people who usually pick their own subcontractors. Vince, who runs a small building-supply company (and whose last name and firm I agreed to keep anonymous), is the low bidder. Trump wants him lower.\n\n“Vince, can you do the job for $500,000? You’re at $667,000. We’re going to give it out today.”\n\n“Donald, you know what’s happened to steel. It’s doubled in price,” Vince starts.\n\n“Not doubled, but it’s gone up,” says Trump. “But you bought your shit years ago. I hear business is good for you.”\n\n“No, it’s not. I need a job, Donald. I need your job. Can you give me 660?”\n\n“No, I can’t do it for that,” says Trump. “How ’bout 550?”\n\nVince says no and starts listing all the work he’s done for Trump. As he continues, Trump puts him on mute and starts talking to the guys in his office about Vince. Finally he hits the mute button again and interrupts him.\n\n“Vince, you don’t have to talk me into it. Do the job for 600.”\n\n“Donald, give me 640, and you’ll get the best.”\n\n“Okay, 625. Sign him at $625,000,” Trump says to his contractors. “Good luck, Vince. Take care. Good luck. Do a good job. Bye-bye.”\n\nVince goes silent. Trump hangs up.\n\nIn earlier negotiations that same day, Trump had shaved off about $1 million in costs to what will eventually be a $100 million construction bill for the building. Vince’s part was pocket change. Trump haggled with him not just to show off—though he acknowledged that was part of it—but because he loves doing it.\n\nAnd he loves to get his hands just as deep into the rest of the organization. He calls employees up to see how business is, or to find out whether a certain kind of sand has come in, or to tell them that they should be prepared for a delivery of nine chandeliers. In the casinos he walks the floor, asking everyone from doormen to table operators to executives how things are going and what’s going wrong. If a uniform is out of place or a table messy, he demands that it be taken care of. “He can be tough—he has no problem laying anyone out,” says Larry Mullin, the former president and COO of Atlantic City casino Trump Marina, and now an executive vice president at Trump-trumping casino Borgata. “But he can be supportive and encouraging, because he wants to win.” One thing employees don’t see: e-mail. The boss doesn’t use it. The only computer in his office sits unplugged on the windowsill.\n\nRead More: Is Donald Trump Racist? Here’s What the Record Shows\n\nThere are plenty of executives, of course, who bypass the company hierarchy to find out what’s going on. Where Trump again gets unreal is in the loyalty he demands—and doles out—to employees. In 1989, Greg Cuneo was a 27-year-old project engineer on one of Trump’s construction sites. When the firm he worked for was sold, Cuneo decided to strike out on his own. He asked to see Trump and was ushered in. In a private meeting, Trump listened to Cuneo’s plan and told him that he’d back him in his new company—and within days Cuneo had a contract with Trump. “He said, ‘Greg, I’m going to make you a millionaire,'” Cuneo recalls. “I said, ‘Donald, I don’t think that’s a bad idea.'” Since then Cuneo, chairman of HRH Construction, has been involved with almost all of Trump’s biggest buildings, and he has grown used to Trump’s regular calls to tell him what kind of wood to use on lockers or complain that stone has been laid the wrong way. “The sickest thing about working for him is that he’s involved in every detail,” Cuneo says.\n\nAnd though Trump came from a wealthy family and went to Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance—”the best school, rated by Business Week as the best school,” he says, perhaps relying on figures from 2000, when Wharton was ranked No. 1—he doesn’t care about backgrounds or degrees when figuring out whom to keep or whom to move up. When he buys a building, he rarely fires en masse, and people on the site sometimes find themselves subsumed into Trump’s world.\n\nThat’s what happened to Vincent Stellio. In 1992, Stellio was working security at the Plaza hotel, which Trump then owned. When Trump and then-wife Marla Maples had a daughter, Trump hired Stellio as the girl’s bodyguard. One day Trump, who had just bought his golf course properties in New York, called Stellio into his office and told him that from then on Stellio would oversee the work. “He said, ‘You’re a smart guy, very dependable, loyal, and you know how to get things done. I have a lot of confidence in you.'”\n\nOver the years Trump has stuck with Stellio, extending his responsibilities to overseeing construction at all the golf properties. And while Stellio says that the learning curve was steep at first, Trump is willing to give people breaks. “It’s when you repeat the mistake, though, that he gets fired up,” says Stellio.\n\nFor their loyalty, employees, contractors, and outside attorneys get trips to Mar-a-Lago or memberships in the golf clubs. Trump remembers birthdays and sends checks at deaths. But those who violate his loyalty find themselves frozen out quickly. When former Trump Marina COO Mullin announced he was quitting, he received a personal letter from Trump blasting him for “betrayal.” Trump says being cut off is the price people pay for moving on: “I’ve had many people leave who want to come back because they miss the Trump action. I would never have them back.”\n\nIf it sounds cultish, that’s because it is. Some people who work for Trump even end up sounding like him. The maintenance director of the Trump 727 dismissed other private planes with their “fiberboard and other types of paneling.” He explained, “This plane has only real wood, veneered wood. All done by Italian craftsmen.” Also, the pilots’ seats—all sheepskin. “The airlines, they have cloth,” he said. The former director of the Trump Spa at Mar-a-Lago, a chiropractor named Ginger Southall, said she learned to think big and motivate others by watching Trump in action: “He gets you excited about whatever you’re doing. Even if it’s a big pile of doody, he can get you excited.” A minute later, however, she was selling me on herself: Did I know that she had climbed Mount McKinley, which “obviously has to do with my inner strength”? Also, the person I should really be writing about is her current employer, who owns a nutritional supplements company—”He’s the Donald Trump of the natural health and wellness industry!”\n\nSo what matters to Trump? Certainly, being hailed as a great builder: Over the course of a few weeks, he told me a handful of times that the real story is his success in real estate. “If you’re honest, when this is through, you’ll say Trump is much bigger than people understood,” he said on the flight to L.A. But the truth is—well, with Trump, of course, it’s almost impossible to know. His property on the West Side of Manhattan is doing well, but how much does he own? He says 50%, but his partners won’t go into details or reveal documents. His holdings in the casino business are shrinking by the day. Even how well he did at J.P. Weaver, the molding company, is a mystery. He says he got a fantastic deal. The firm’s owner laughs, “Honey, we only have one price, and I tried to indicate that that day.”\n\nOne thing is undeniable: Trump’s TV show is huge. Yet it’s about the show that Trump seems a bit baffled, if proud. One morning in the limo in Los Angeles, he takes a call from NBC about the previous night’s Nielsen ratings for his show. The Apprentice came close to beating CBS’s CSI and actually tied it in the last half-hour. Trump can’t help but inflate the news. Hanging up, he ignores the first part and announces that The Apprentice tied CSI. Then he starts laughing—and briefly I get a peek behind the mask. “I’m just a fucking businessman,” he says. “It’s crazy, right? It’s a crazy world.”\n\nReporter Associates Jenny Mero and Helen Kim\n\nA version of this article appears in the April 19, 2004 issue of Fortune with the headline “The Trophy Life You think Donald Trump’s hit reality show is a circus?

The unanimous opinion effectively raises the bar for what computer programs can be patented, helping to limit the number of \"bad\" patents entering the system and the number of lawsuits that can be filed by patent trolls.\n\nBut intellectual property experts are a little put out by the decision in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank. Here's why: While the court struck down what was universally said to be a bad patent, it didn't do much to say what kinds of software should be patentable. In other words, the court decided the most basic conflict in the case, but more or less declined to offer guidance for other, future cases.\n\n\"It was supposed to be the most important patent case of the decade,\" said Todd Dickinson, the executive director of the American Intellectual Property Law Association. \"It turned out to be a little bit like fireworks that fizzled. It didn't really seem to move the needle much either way.\"\n\nWhat many were hoping for was some kind of legal test from the court that would help businesses determine what kinds of software could be patented. Designing such a test would have been complicated, and maybe even impossible. But at the very least, maybe the court would agree to clarify what, if anything, about software should be considered an \"abstract idea\"?\n\nNo luck. Writing on behalf of the court, Justice Clarence Thomas explicitly said he didn't need to deal with the abstract-idea problem, because the facts of the case were so obviously against the company with the bad patents, Australia-based Alice Corp., which had received a patent for a computer-aided process to protect the parties in foreign currency transactions.\n\n\"We need not labor to delimit the precise contours of the 'abstract ideas' category in this case,\" Thomas wrote.\n\nThat line quickly drew criticism from some legal observers on Twitter.\n\n@Lawgeek @BrianJLove That obscurity, coupled w/ \"we need not labor to delimit,\" translates to: someone else figure it out, see ya in 5 years\n\n— Brad Greenberg (@bradagreenberg) June 19, 2014\n\nPatent reform advocates said that in light of the court's limits, only legislation could really prevent the use of bad patents in litigation.\n\n\"Unfortunately, neither today's ruling nor any single act by the court or the executive branch can do what is needed to make the business model of being a patent troll unprofitable and unattractive,\" said Matt Tanelian, executive director of the Coalition for Patent Fairness, which represents tech companies including Google and Samsung.\n\nOthers, such as the Chicago-based software company Trading Technologies International, pointed out that the ruling would have a limited impact \"because very few patent claims are even arguably directed to a fundamental economic practice\" like the kind at issue in the case before the Court.\n\nSo while the court's decision doesn't rule out the possibility of narrowing the scope of patentability further down the road, it doesn't seem as though it's done much to settle the broader question of patentability this time.\n\nBrian Fung covers technology for The Washington Post.\n\nSECTION: {section=business/technology, subsection=null}!!!

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00001-of-00064--989", "original_text": "Jennifer Pan, 28, fed her parents lies about her success and then hired hit men to kill them. (Court exhibit)\n\nFor a while, Jennifer Pan’s parents regarded her as their “golden” child.\n\nThe young Canadian woman, who lived in the city of Markham just north of Toronto, was a straight A student at a Catholic school who won scholarships and early acceptance to college. True to her father’s wishes, she graduated from the University of Toronto’s prestigious pharmacology program and went on to work at a blood-testing lab at SickKids hospital.\n\nPan’s accomplishments used to make her mother and father, Bich Ha and Huei Hann Pan, brim with pride. After all, they had arrived in Toronto as refugees from Vietnam, working as laborers for an auto parts manufacturer so their two kids could have the bright future that they couldn’t attain for themselves.\n\nBut in Pan’s case, that perfect fate was all an elaborate lie. She failed to graduate from high school, let alone the University of Toronto, as she had told her parents. Her trial, for plotting with hit men to kill her parents, ended in January, and she’s serving a long sentence. But the full story of this troubled young woman is just now being told as a complete and powerful narrative by someone who knew her — and indeed, it’s searing.\n\nIn a story published in Toronto Life magazine last week, reporter Karen Ho detailed the intricate web of deception that her high school classmate at Mary Ward Catholic Secondary School in north Scarborough spun to prevent her parents from discovering the unimaginable: that their golden child was, in fact, failing. Using court documents and interviews, Ho pieced together Pan’s descent from a precocious elementary schooler to a chronic liar who forged report cards, scholarship letters and university transcripts — all to preserve an image of perfection. The headline: “Jennifer Pan’s Revenge: the inside story of a golden child, the killers she hired, and the parents she wanted dead.”\n\n[Harlem principal who committed suicide admitted she cheated on state exams, officials say]\n\n[Maddy Middleton, 8-year-old girl missing in Santa Cruz, found dead in a dumpster]\n\nTheir high school, Ho wrote, “was the perfect community for a student like Jennifer. A social butterfly with an easy, high-pitched laugh, she mixed with guys, girls, Asians, Caucasians, jocks, nerds, people deep into the arts. Outside of school, Jennifer swam and practiced the martial art of wushu.” But Ho would “discover later that Jennifer’s friendly, confident persona was a façade, beneath which she was tormented by feelings of inadequacy, self-doubt and shame.”\n\nAmong the signs that few saw were cuts on her forearms, self-inflicted.\n\nThe real Jennifer never enrolled in university. She never graduated from high school.\n\n“Jennifer’s parents assumed their daughter was an A student,” wrote Ho in the article. “In truth, she earned mostly Bs—respectable for most kids but unacceptable in her strict household. So Jennifer continued to doctor her report cards throughout high school. She received early acceptance” to Ryerson University in Toronto, “but then failed calculus in her final year and wasn’t able to graduate. The university withdrew its offer. Desperate to keep her parents from digging into her high school records, she lied and said she’d be starting at Ryerson in the fall. She said her plan was to do two years of science, then transfer over to U of T’s pharmacology program, which was her father’s hope. Hann was delighted and bought her a laptop. Jennifer collected used biology and physics textbooks and bought school supplies. In September, she pretended to attend frosh week. When it came to tuition, she doctored papers stating she was receiving an OSAP loan and convinced her dad she’d won a $3,000 scholarship. She would pack up her book bag and take public transit downtown. Her parents assumed she was headed to class. Instead, Jennifer would go to public libraries …..”\n\nShe pretended to be transferring to the University of Toronto and indeed, to be graduating from it, telling her parents when it came time for the graduation ceremony that there weren’t enough tickets to go around and they would not be able to attend.\n\nUltimately, Ho wrote, Pan’s parents finally got suspicious, began tailing her and learned the truth.\n\nWhen she confessed her deceptions, life in the Pan household quickly began to unravel.\n\nBich and Hann had raised Jennifer and her brother, Felix, to believe in the supreme importance of academic success, and they restricted their activities to ensure nothing less. Pan, whose high school life included numerous extracurricular activities, like figure skating, piano, martial arts and swimming, in addition to long nights studying, was forbidden from attending parties of any kind. Dating was out of the question. In their Markham home, they had trophy cases displaying Pan’s many awards.\n\nWhen Pan’s parents learned that all of their efforts had been for naught, they placed further restrictions on their now-adult daughter. No more cellphone. No more laptop. No more clandestine dates with her boyfriend, Daniel Wong.\n\nWhile she eventually gained more freedom, Pan stayed angry. She thought about how much better her life would be without her parents. And so, with Daniel’s help, she plotted to kill the two people who had made her life like “house arrest.”\n\nPan’s parents, Huei Hann and Bich Ha Pan, arrived in Canada as political refugees from Vietnam. (Court exhibit)\n\nThe scene described in Toronto Life and earlier in the trial is gruesome. In a planned murder disguised to look like a robbery gone awry, Pan played the part of helpless witness as three hired hit men, David Mylvaganam, Lenford Crawford and allegedly Eric Carty, fatally shot her mother and severely wounded her father. She called 911, distraught, to bolster the illusion.\n\nAnd the initial headlines supported it: “Markham’s Bich Ha Pan was gunned down inside her own home during what appears to have been a random home invasion,” reported the Markham Economist & Sun. “Markham killing shocks neighbours.” “Home invasion suspects ‘pose very real danger'; Markham police warn residents after woman killed in random attack,” said the Toronto Star.\n\nBut police officers investigating the case caught on within a couple weeks. This lie — that an immigrant couple was shot by random burglars and not through the will of their daughter — would have to be Pan’s last.\n\nThis January, an Ontario court found Pan and her three-co accused (Wong, Crawford and Mylvaganam) guilty of first-degree murder and attempted murder. They were all handed life sentences with no chance of parole for 25 years. Carty, who has pleaded not guilty, will be tried separately.\n\nWhile Pan’s trial was heavily reported in the Toronto press, it turned out to represent only a fragment of a more complex and tangled story, told by Ho.\n\nThe Toronto Life piece, in part because it was reported and researched by a former classmate familiar with Pan’s life, offered an account of the complications leading up to her horrific deed. Since it was published last Wednesday, the article has been widely shared on Facebook, striking a powerful chord with Asian immigrant children in Canada and the U.S. who have taken to social media to share tales of childhoods characterized by high expectations and the crippling fear associated with not meeting them.\n\nPan’s case tells the story of Asian immigrants’ dreams turned to violent nightmare. The saga is fraught with many of the tensions that have pervaded discussions surrounding Asian immigrant communities in recent years, from the “model minority” myth to the debate over whether Asian parenting yields better results. As attention is drawn to the mental health issues among Asian Americans, it now also fuels questions about how much pressure is too much.\n\nIt’s a mistake to take one case and generalize or stereotype, noted Jennifer Lee, a sociology professor at the University of California Irvine who specializes in Asian American life in America. And she said, it would be a mistake to attribute Pan’s troubles to “tiger parenting.”\n\nPan’s story is an extreme case. “It’s so easy to blame immigrant parents,” said Lee, who co-authored the recently released book “The Asian American Achievement Paradox.” “The danger of highlighting cases like Jennifer’s is that they contribute to a misconception that all Asian American kids experience this extreme pressure and are mentally unstable.”\n\nBut she said, “Jennifer’s parents certainly had a role in making her feel trapped, but I think there’s a broader discussion to be had about the expectations that teachers, peers and institutions place on people like Jennifer to fit that stereotype of the exceptional Asian American student.”\n\n[Why Asian American kids excel. It’s not ‘Tiger Moms.’]\n\n“Ultimately, it’s a horrible crime,” writer Ho said in an interview with The Washington Post. “But because so many people have gone through the experience of growing up like Jennifer, it’s not unfathomable to them that someone would just break.”\n\nHo said the expectations placed on many Asian American children “have a huge long-term impact on your ability to withstand failure.” She added, “You just grow up chronically afraid. This buildup of lies is because Jennifer felt like the alternative was just unfathomable.”\n\n“The more I learned about Jennifer’s strict upbringing,” Ho wrote, “the more I could relate to her. I grew up with immigrant parents who also came to Canada from Asia (in their case Hong Kong) with almost nothing, and a father who demanded a lot from me. My dad expected me to be at the top of my class, especially in math and science, to always be obedient, and to be exemplary in every other way. He wanted a child who was like a trophy — something he could brag about.”\n\nIn the Reddit discussion of the story, one user, who created a new account in order to comment anonymously, writes: “…. This story did a number on me, because my life used to resemble hers. I come from an Asian family, with a lot of that immigrant parent mentality. I was an exceptional student in high school, getting scholarships for university and having my pick on which to attend. And then it went downhill from there.”\n\nHe also lived at home, pretending to have a respectable job: “[My parents] gave me everything, sacrificed so much for my success, and this was the result.” But unlike Pan, he adds, “I accepted those conditions from my parents to fix my life …. I don’t have any sympathy for Jennifer Pan because I feel like I was in her shoes. After her parents found out, her dad reacted similar to mine, so did her mom.”\n\nBut, he wrote, “I used the opportunity to get my life back, she used it to wreck hers.”", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nJennifer Pan, 28, fed her parents lies about her success and then hired hit men to kill them.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00006-of-00064--290", "original_text": "On the top floor of Random House's offices in London, the world's number one thinker – according to Prospect magazine's annual poll – walks in from the roof terrace and shakes my hand. Richard Dawkins is a trim 72-year-old with one of those faces that, no matter the accumulation of lines, will always draw the adjective \"boyish\".\n\nThere's a smoothness to the way he carries himself – a touch of the Nigel Havers – that could no doubt be construed as an arrogance befitting his intellectual status, but in conversation he is restrained, even hesitant, and faultlessly modest throughout our interview.\n\nPerhaps the renowned evolutionary biologist and the world's most famous atheist was feeling especially cautious. The day before I met him he had become embroiled in a Twitterstorm, which grew into a broader media monsoon, after he had tweeted the following: \"All the world's Muslims have fewer Nobel prizes than Trinity College, Cambridge. They did great things in the middle ages, though.\"\n\nHe defended himself in the ensuing furore by saying that he was merely stating a fact. And it's true, it was a fact. Many objected that it was a fact used to demonise Muslims, that it was racist (Dawkins responded by pointing out that Islam is not a race), and that, out of context, it was, at the very least, mischievous and misleading.\n\nReading this on mobile? Click here to watch video\n\nI returned later to this dispute, but first of all we got down to discussing his memoir, An Appetite for Wonder, a sort of portrait of the scientist as a young man. The first of two volumes, it takes us from boyhood to the publication of his landmark bestseller, The Selfish Gene. The story begins with his colonial childhood in Kenya and Nyasaland (now Malawi), and is full of dusty anecdotes of our young hero rummaging without a care in the great African outdoors. Does he look back with nostalgia at that now largely disappeared way of life?\n\n\"Yes,\" he says slowly, as if watchful for hidden traps. \"It's now unfashionable and in many ways it's something we British have to live down. But yes, there is a nostalgia for it and, although I was never in India, I get it reading novels of the Raj. It's a lost era that you can't help having a certain affection for, even if you disapprove politically.\"\n\nHis parents were hardy, practical types, unflustered by war or life in the bush or, it seems, anything else. His father was a botanist, working in the agricultural office in Nyasaland, so Dawkins grew up in a family that took a scientific interest in living organisms, though he insists he never inherited his parents' extensive knowledge of flora and fauna.\n\nHe moved to England when he was nine and went through a very typical public school experience for the era, except that he managed to fend off the sexual predations of older boys. Other than in relation to genetic research, sex doesn't raise its titillating head at all in the book – apart from one occasion. We learn that at the ripe age of 22 he lost his virginity to a cellist in London. She \"removed her skirt in order to play to me in her bedsitter (you can't play the cello in a tight skirt) – and then removed everything else.\"\n\nBut that's all that Dawkins allows in terms of romance.\n\n\"Well that was a little token to say, 'This is all you're going to get,' \" he says firmly. \"I wanted to announce that this is not going to be that kind of autobiography.\"\n\nWhy not? \"Fear of betraying confidences,\" he says, shifting in his chair. \"These things are private. Some people let it all hang out but I prefer not to.\"\n\nYou can say that again. Dawkins may have an appetite for wonder, but he is positively anorexic when it comes to personal revelation. Perhaps the most confessional section – and it can hardly be called exposing – deals with his years teaching at Berkeley in the late 60s, when the campus was a hotbed of countercultural revolt. Dawkins took part in protests against the Vietnam war, of which he remains proud, but also got caught up in a local militant initiative to take over some university waste ground and turn it into a \"people's park\". \"With hindsight,\" he writes, \"it was a trumped-up excuse for radical activism for its own sake.\"\n\nI suggest that radical movements invariably function on peer pressure and he agrees that he succumbed to the impulse to belong. \"There was a sort of feeling of flower power and drugs,\" he says. \"I never actually took drugs, oddly enough. I never had the opportunity. But the music of the time and the atmosphere – there was a feeling of loyalty to the protesters: these are my people. The same people who marched against the Vietnam war marched for the people's park and it was an automatic decision to join them. One should be more independent-minded than that.\"\n\nThat's Dawkins at his most self-reflective. He avoids any details of interest about his first marriage – to the ethologist Marian Stamp. And according to him, he is unlikely to be any more forthcoming in the second volume about his second marriage to Eve Barham, or his third to the actress Lalla Ward, a former assistant to Dr Who, who was introduced to him by his late friend Douglas Adams.\n\nThe couple live in Oxford, where Dawkins has resided almost all of his adult life, and where he spent 13 years until his retirement in 2008 as the professor for public understanding of life. As he was free in that role to pursue his own interests, he says his \"nominal retirement\" has made no difference at all.\n\nThe memoir is strong on the professional excitement of his early years as an academic, but it assiduously sidesteps the rivalries and disputes that mark even the most unremarkable scientific careers, let alone one as distinguished as Dawkins's. He didn't want any score settling, he says, or to \"appear hostile\".\n\nSo although he notes that the biologists Richard Lewontin and Steven Rose were two of the rare voices who criticised The Selfish Gene on its widely acclaimed publication in 1976, he fails to discuss their arguments or his thoughts on them, other than to say that both came from the \"political left\". Did he think their case against him was political rather than scientific?\n\n\"Yes, I think politics,\" he says after another anxious pause. \"I actually wrote a fairly savage review of the joint book they produced later [Not in Our Genes] which I suppose I'll probably mention in volume two.\" He weighs his words again and then adds, \"It was sarcastic rather than savage.\"\n\nDawkins seems determined in both the memoir and our interview to present a calm, conciliatory side to his character that has not always been associated with his public image. Later the photographer, Andy Hall, will tell me that Dawkins requested to look at the screen on Hall's camera to see what he had captured during the shoot. \"You've made me look too harsh,\" complained the biologist.\n\nHall told him he was merely giving him appropriate gravitas.\n\n\"I don't want fucking gravitas,\" Dawkins snapped. \"I want humanity.\"\n\nOne senses that for all the recognition he's garnered – the world's leading intellectual, the bestselling books, the rapt audiences etc – Dawkins would like to be a little more loved. I ask him if he thinks he's misunderstood by the media and the general public.\n\n\"Yes,\" he says without hesitation. \"I seem to be perceived as aggressive and strident and I don't actually think I am strident and aggressive. What I think is that we have all become so accustomed to seeing religion ring-fenced by a wall of special protection that when someone delivers even a mild criticism of religion, it's heard as aggressive when it isn't. I like to think I'm more thoughtful and reflective.\"\n\nAlthough he has only written one book specifically about religion – The God Delusion – it's the subject that has increasingly come to define Dawkins. He may have spread the message of evolution to millions, and he may have helped revolutionise our understanding of genetic biology, but it's his pronouncements on the irrationality and absurdity of religion that stick most prominently in the public's imagination. He's that bloke.\n\nReading this on mobile? Click here to watch video\n\nDawkins has long maintained that there is no real difference between his work on evolution and his anti-religion position as an atheist. To some extent, he has a point. As he puts it: \"I suppose my particular branch of biology is kind of in the front-line trench where religion is fighting evolution. So in a way even my science books are forced to take a stance, not against posh theologians who accept evolution but surely the absolute majority of religious people in the world who literally believe that every species was separately created and even, in the case of the Abrahamic religions, believe that Adam and Eve were created 6,000 years ago. Chemists and other scientists don't have to battle with that.\"\n\nWhile this may be true, no other evolutionary biologist has been quite as outspoken as Dawkins in his denunciation of religion and, indeed, the religious. As a consequence, he's the go-to guy for a scathing quote on dissembling theologies and their gullible believers. He was led into attacking Peter Kay (although he later said he was unaware of who Kay was) when the comedian said that he found religion comforting; savaged the historian Paul Johnson for the \"ignominious, contemptible, retarded\" basis on which he held his religious beliefs; and described the British Airways employee who was suspended for wearing a gold cross at work as having \"one of the most stupid faces I have ever seen\".\n\nHis comments about religion grew noticeably less restrained after the 9/11 attacks in America. It was those religiously inspired acts of terrorism that prompted Dawkins to write The God Delusion. He had wanted to write the book immediately after the twin towers were destroyed but was dissuaded by his agent, who told him that America would never buy a book that was so avowedly critical of religion. He waited several years and the book was eventually published in 2006. But as many observers have since noted, the people who flew planes into the World Trade Centre were motivated by a powerful belief in Islam, while The God Delusion was a sustained critique of Christianity.\n\n\"It concentrates on Christianity,\" he says, \"because it's the religion I know a lot about, having been brought up in Christian schools.\"\n\nAll the same, it seemed a little perverse to be galvanised by the acts of followers of one religion to set about debunking the presumptions of another, especially as Christianity, particularly in Europe, and specifically in Britain, had become largely a toothless affair which had almost reformed itself out of existence. Did he really think that Christianity matters very much nowadays?\n\n\"Ayaan Hirsi Ali has at times suggested that Christianity might [in relative terms] be a good thing, like the Hilaire Belloc line: 'Always keep a-hold of nurse for fear of finding something worse'. I'm occasionally tempted by that view that maybe it would be a shame if Christianity died.\" But then he goes on to insist that a more muscular and sinister version of Christianity is flourishing in many parts of the world.\n\nDouglas Murray, an outspoken critic of many aspects of Islam, recently lambasted Dawkins for taking the easy target of Christianity and ignoring the more problematic question of the Islamic world. \"He can't have read anything I've actually written,\" Dawkins says. \"Just this week I'm assailed mightily for going after Islam and had been for a very long time before that.\"\n\nThis \"going after Islam\" refers to his Twitter contribution on the number of Muslim Nobel laureates. But there's a distinction to be made between \"going after Islam\" – ie criticising the Koran and the Islamic prophet, Muhammad – and going after Muslims. The latter is likely to lead to accusations of racism and bigotry, which Dawkins duly received, while the former can bring far more threatening consequences He insists that he wasn't speaking of Muslims as an undifferentiated mass. He merely wanted to highlight how Islam, which produced algebra and kept safe the Greek philosophers of antiquity in the middle ages, had lost its way scientifically by focusing too much on the study of religion.\n\n\"The point I wished to make is that something about the Muslim cultural tradition seems to be inimical to doing science. I mean an Egyptian Muslim, a Pakistani Muslim and an Indonesian Muslim, they are not all the same, clearly. One thing they have in common is their religion. And one could make the case that the Islamic religion is not friendly to science. That's not saying anything about all Muslims.\"\n\nHe sounds genuinely offended that anyone could think otherwise. He does regret, he says, the comparison with Trinity College. He wishes he had set contemporary Muslim academic achievement against that of the Jews. \"Something like between 20% and 25% of all Nobel prizes have gone to Jews, who are less than 1% of the world's population. That's a very embarrassing comparison.\"\n\nI suggest that this may not have been wise. Leaving aside the sensitivities surrounding the Arab-Israeli conflict, you can also argue that Jews are a race. \"No you can't!\" he replies. \"It's just total nonsense to talk about Jews being a race. That's precisely where Hitler went wrong.\"\n\nBy now my controversy seismometer is going off the Richter scale: Muslims, Jews, Hitler – it's like a mass invitation to every irate commentator in the blogosphere. For while Dawkins's arguments tend to be studiously rational, they are not always couched in the language of provisos, exceptions and disclaimers that is necessary to avoid the minefield of cultural sensitivities. Instead he places a high premium on clarity, which his critics often see as simplicity or a lack of intellectual sophistication.\n\nIn a sort of half-compliment towards his demystifying style of writing on evolutionary biology, Fay Weldon once called him a \"poetic reductionist\". Sometimes in his commentary on religion, the poetry can go missing. The Spectator rather cruelly called him \"the Mary Whitehouse of our day\", as if the religious debate had turned him into a busybody bore.\n\nWhen I ask him if he's not tempted to back away from public pronouncements on religion, given all the grief it generates, not least for himself, he says, a little wearily: \"No, I don't think so. It is important. I think it is worthwhile.\"\n\nBut it seems apparent that some air has gone out of the New Atheist balloon, particularly with the death of Christopher Hitchens. Dawkins agrees. \"He was irreplaceable, probably the greatest orator I've ever heard. Such articulate cogency and a splendid voice like Richard Burton.\"\n\nOf course, while there are endless ways to describe an omnipotent god, and his various moral commands, there are a limited number of ways to state his non-existence. For Hitchens, says Dawkins, the argument was political. \"He saw god as a kind of divine North Korea.\" But Dawkins maintains that his own beef has always been scientific. \"I'm passionately interested in the truth about the universe and I've always thought of the existence of an intelligent creator as a scientific hypothesis. A universe with a creator would be a totally different kind of universe scientifically speaking than one without.\"\n\nBut he also has an aesthetic opposition. \"Yes,\" he agrees, \"because I do think that the scientific worldview is so wonderful and poetically uplifting that the children who don't get it and are being fed a second-rate alternative are being short-changed.\"\n\nIt's not the most profound psychological insight to suggest that Dawkins's intolerance of religion may stem from his own brief period of \"religious frenzy\" as a teenager at Oundle school. His belief in a supreme creator was only deepened by his love of Elvis Presley, a fellow believer. What saved him was a schoolfriend who persuaded him of the brilliance of Darwin's idea.\n\nEverything comes back to the science with Dawkins, and sooner or later everything comes back to evolution. I ask him if Darwinism informs his everyday apprehension of life.\n\n\"Well, in one way it does. My eyes are constantly wide open to the extraordinary fact of existence. Not just human existence but the existence of life and how this breathtakingly powerful process, which is natural selection, has managed to take the very simple facts of physics and chemistry and build them up to redwood trees and humans. That's never far from my thoughts, that sense of amazement. On the other hand I certainly don't allow Darwinism to influence my feelings about human social life.\"\n\nApart from anything else, that last sentence is a necessary defence against the accusation that Dawkins sees humans simply as the \"survival machines\" he described in The Selfish Gene, organisms whose only purpose is gene reproduction. Dawkins argues that we as individuals can opt out of Darwinism. For while we may be compelled by biology, we are freed by consciousness.\n\nThis sets up a fascinating battle between, as it were, the mind and the body, the conscious self and the survival machine. Dawkins agrees and says that it's a question that requires much more research. But he cites pain as one of the potential battlefields that ought to be examined.\n\n\"From a Darwinian perspective it is clear what pain is doing. It's a warning: don't do that again. If you burn yourself you're never going to pick up a live coal again. But you might think a little red flag in the brain would be enough to do that. Why does pain have to be so damned painful?\"\n\nHis answer is that our brains have evolved to treat certain things as rewards and others as punishments. \"And those can run away so that you can become hedonistic to the extent that you neglect your Darwinian responsibilities, and we do all the time. So it could be that this tussle between the genetic imperative and the brain leads to pain becoming so painful that, as it were, the hedonistic brain can't overrule.\"\n\nBut clearly hedonistic consciousness is capable of overcoming our biological programming. The more materially successful a society becomes, the better educated and more physically comfortable, the less inclined its members are to reproduce. If we, like Dawkins, view the evolutionary determinant as the survival of the gene rather than the species, then is that not a problem for genes whose survival machines are reluctant to reproduce?\n\n\"Well this worried my dear colleague Bill Hamilton,\" he answers, \"and he got a lot of stick for it. It is an unfashionable point of view and one of the reasons it has become unfashionable is Hitler. In pre-Hitler times eugenics was very much a cause of the left, and Hitler did for all that. It's not a view I go out of my way to espouse but it possibly is a worry. R A Fisher, probably the greatest Darwinian of the first half of the 20th century, deliberately had lots of children because he knew he was bright.\"\n\nThis is not an accusation that could be levelled at Dawkins. He has one child, a 29-year-old daughter from his second marriage. But just in case I walk away with the wrong idea, in spite of his own example, he adds: \"So while it's probably true that there is something a bit dysgenic about what you've just identified, I would absolutely hate to see any kind of draconian attempts to reduce the reproduction of some people at the expense of others.\"\n\nThat's a relief. Twitter would probably have crashed under the strain of that backlash and who knows what would have happened to the Guardian website. Instead we part company on a benign note, without controversy or dispute, the great humanist having succeeded in showing his humanity.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nOn the top floor of Random House's offices in London, the world's number one thinker – according to Prospect magazine's annual poll – walks in from the roof terrace and shakes my hand.

They’re two of the most arrogant teams in football, an attitude that stems from their respective head coaches, Bill Belichick and Pete Carroll. When you have two unlikable teams and coaches battling in the biggest game of the year, how do you possibly decide for whom to root? Luckily, FTW is here to break it down for you and let you know which coach will be the least worst to see holding the Lombardi trophy on Sunday.\n\nYou may not have one, but everybody knows someone with the uncle who’s always having money trouble, the occasional brush with the law and a new girlfriend every year with a name like Brandy, Brielle or Genesis. He wears a Paul Simon 1986 Graceland tour T-shirt to Thanksgiving dinner and you always have the perfunctory 30-second conversation with him during which he asks “how’s school” and you reply “I graduated six years ago?” That’s the football Bill Belichick.\n\nHe dresses like a slob, as if to show he’s his own man and no one can tell him what to do. It’s like when a high schooler gets her upper ear pierced against her mother’s wishes. But, okay, creepy may be too harsh. Let’s just say if there was an open seat next to him on the subway, you’d opt to stand instead.\n\nThe deflated footballs are a fantastic story but, ultimately, there’s not enough there there to turn it into anything more than great media fodder and some minor offseason sanctions. It will fill the radio and TV airwaves during Super Bowl week and then will be forgotten exactly at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday when the game kicks off. This will barely be a blip on Belichick’s football obituary.\n\nBut Spygate? Oh my. If Spygate happened today — hoo boy. A team illegally taping other practices? Reports that it happened before a Super Bowl? A half-million dollar fine? A half-hearted Belichick apology — so much more oily than those mind games he played this week? Destroyed tapes? TMZ would have had its hands on those in no time, or at least the iPhone video of some stadium worker who saw it happening.\n\nWith all his creepy (there’s that word again) videotaping fixations, Belichick is like his own episode of Law & Order: SVU. Logan Mankins could have been one of the guys loading a truck at the beginning of the show while getting questioned by police. “Videotapes of the Jets. No, never heard anything about that. Sorry, gotta run, we have a shipment that’s already running late.”\n\nBut back to Deflategate. Did that seriously happen during a game everyone was watching? Not that Belichick did it himself, but I’ve seen better cheating in my high-school math class … when I would lean over the goodie-goodie in front of me and ask my friend out loud what she got for No. 7.\n\nMarcel Marceau thinks Belichick should talk more. He gives one word answers at press conferences, messes around with injury reports and views the media as a nuisance, not as the way to hype the sport that pays him millions of dollars. Then again, this strategy it seems to be working just fine for him.\n\nAdam Vinatieri: Belichick savior. (USA TODAY Sports Images)\n\nThree Super Bowl wins: Two thanks to Adam Vinatieri’s right foot and one thanks, in large part, to Donovan McNabb’s gastrointestinal fortitude, or lack thereof. This isn’t to mention the Tuck Rule and Vinatieri’s miracle kick during that snowstorm in the 2001 divisional playoff against the Raiders.\n\nBelichick’s defenses are always great and he’s a magician at squeezing the best out of mediocre talent. (Remember when wide receiver Troy Brown used to play cornerback?) But when his teams win big games, it tends to be because of Tom Brady, a quarterback with whom Belichick has limited contact with during the week and games. We’re not privy to the inside workings of the Pats, but watch the coach on Sunday: He’ll sometimes be talking to the defense and have his back turned when the offense is on the field.\n\nSo give me the two coaches who also have three Super Bowl wins, like Belichick. Joe Gibbs won three Super Bowls with three different quarterbacks (an underrated feat) and had full control of his offense. I’ll also take Bill Walsh who created his own offense. What did Belichick do? He watched Adam Vinatieri win him three Super Bowls.\n\nThat’s not to say Belichick plays no role in the Pats’ and Brady’s greatness. He and the revolving door of offensive coordinators who have come through Foxborough set up the game plan every week. Belichick is very hands on, though Josh McDaniels or Charlie Weis or Bill O’Brien work with the offense and deserve more credit. But defense is still Belichick’s main focus. And those defenses lost fourth-quarter leaders in the last two Super Bowl losses to the New York Giants.\n\nEven Rich Kotite lasted longer.\n\nIn case you forgot, Belichick was involved in that bizarre 1997 incident in which he was named a one-year coach of the Jets, keeping the seat warm for his mentor, Bill Parcells, who was barred by the New England Patriots from coaching that season. Eventually, Paul Tagliabue negotiated a settlement (a commissioner who makes decisive decisions — imagine that!) and Parcells got to coach New York. Belichick served as his assistant until the Pats hired him in 2000.\n\nThis is Pete Carroll almost 20 years ago. (AP Photo/Jim Rogash)\n\nCarroll is the second-oldest coach in the NFL, behind Tom Coughlin, who looks old enough to have voted for Roosevelt (either one). Was Carroll the real-life inspiration for Twilight? Does he get the ol’ Hollywood treatments? Did he do what Ponce de Leon couldn’t? (Or are you a truther about the existence of the fountain of youth? And, no, we’re not even getting into that lunacy.) Look at it this way: Carroll, 63, is the same age as Star Wars hero Mark Hamill.\n\nThe same age, I said.\n\nCarroll is always praising the Seahawks too-famous fans, but earlier this season he told them to “suck it up” after the team’s slow start. They would, but it’s too hard to concentrate with all that noise piping into CenturyLink Field.\n\nFive months before USC was slammed with sanctions stemming from a scandal involving Reggie Bush, the coach bolted for Seattle. That’s his prerogative — there were always whispers he wanted back in the NFL one day. But he didn’t just leave USC hanging, he sat there and watched as they were thrown off the building. He was John McClane and USC was Hans Gruber.\n\nBut here’s the best part: Carroll says he never would have left had he known the NCAA sanctions were coming. Hell, *I* knew the NCAA sanctions were coming. Anyone with access to ESPN or a transistor radio knew the sanctions were coming. They were harsher than expected, but no one’s buying the fact that Carroll thinks USC was getting off with a strongly-worded letter. Still, Carroll told the Los Angeles Times he “would never have been able to leave under those circumstances,” referring to the major sanctions. Yeah, and all that noise at CenturyLink Field is natural.\n\nWhen those penalties were announced, Carroll said in a video statement that he was “absolutely shocked and disappointed in the findings of the N.C.A.A.”\n\nYeah, the NCAA should have sucked it up, right?. (Also, who makes a video statement. You’re not Fidel Castro, bro.)\n\nAgain, I harbor no ill-will for Carroll bailing. He’d have been an idiot to stay at USC with both penalties and an NFL offer pending. But don’t martyr yourself after the fact. Own your well-timed exit.\n\nNo one likes that guy.\n\nBefore he escaped from L.A., Carroll was criticized for going for a touchdown while up 21-7 with 54 seconds left. That didn’t bother some (myself included), because the opposing coach, Rick Neuheisel, had just called a timeout after USC’s Matt Barkley took a knee to end the game. If one team’s going to keep playing, the other is entitled to do the same. But what’s galling about this incident is that Carroll had just ripped Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh for doing the exact same thing a few weeks before. What’s good for the goose isn’t good for the arrogant, gray-haired gander.\n\nCarson Palmer and Matt Leinart played until they were seniors while Carroll was at USC, so when Mark Sanchez announced he was leaving after his junior season, Carroll was surprised but supported his player’s dream of playing in the NFL. Oh, no, my bad, he dumped all over the decision and acted like a petulant baby, even refusing to sit next to Sanchez at the press conference. There, he said through gritted teeth:\n\n“We’ve talked at great depth and great length. We’ve covered this from A to Z … going until late last night. We don’t see this decision the same. [But] I’m thrilled for Mark. For any of our kids to live the dream and do what they want to do with their football career, this is a great place to do this. […]\n\nIn happier times, when Carroll played Sanchez and the Eagles. (US ATODAY Sports Images)\n\nAnd then a few minutes later:\n\n“We have compelling information working against the choice going this way.”\n\nIt’s one thing to advise a player privately to stay in school. It’s fine to sit at the press conference and act as if this isn’t a time to celebrate. But it’s an another thing to bash said player while he’s sitting six feet away.\n\nThe coaches in 2005. (Getty Images)\n\nUgh, this is so hard. It’s like going to a restaurant where the only items on the menu are haggis and Arby’s, then following it up with a movie at a theater only showing an Adam Sandler movie or something starring Johnny Depp in a fake mustache. I’d rather listen to a three-hour Kanye West rant about fame, media, police, Autotune, haters and unfair demonization than choose between Bill Belichick or Pete Carroll. But I have to choose one. I owe that to you, the reader.\n\nSo, since both guys have done some sleazy things, at least Bill Belichick doesn’t defend them with half-truths and an attempt at self-martyrdom. He doesn’t care what you think. Plus, he just practically dared the NFL to do something to his Patriots nine days before the Super Bowl and would never, ever, ever, be caught saying “whooooooooo!”\n\nLike FTW on Facebook!

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00001-of-00064--389", "original_text": "Winda Benedetti , NBC News\n\nIf you are the parent of a child or young adult who loves to play video games, then these are the moments when many frightening questions may be bouncing around inside your head.\n\nCould playing video games make my child more aggressive? Do they make young adults antisocial? Most importantly: Can video games inspire a young person to walk into a school and open fire?\n\nIn the wake of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School many politicians and pundits are holding up video games as possible culprit. As a gamer, I question those who are quick to point the finger of blame at a pastime they don't necessarily understand. But as the mother of a kindergartner who loves to play video games, I share the same concerns for his mental health and well-being that any parent does.\n\nArmed with questions, I interviewed two psychiatrists who know much about both kids' mental health ... and video games.\n\nDr. Tyler Black is Clinical Director of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Emergency Unit at BC Children's Hospital in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Dr. Matthew Chow is the Clinical Director of Telepsychiatry at BC Children’s Hospital. Both men have worked extensively with children and young adults dealing with a range of issues including addiction, violence and psychiatric disorders. And both are gamers.\n\nAs many parents are searching for answers in the wake of the recent tragedy, they offered some helpful insights into the affects video games may have on children and offer some suggestions for parents concerned about their child's love of gaming. Read on.\n\nQuestion: In times like these, many parents worry that playing games could be harmful to their children. What advice would you offer to parents with these concerns?\n\nChow: Talk to your children about video games. Ask them what they are playing. Ask them why they play. Join them in play just as you would any other activity. Children need guidance about appropriate values and behavior in games just as much as in the real world. Children need to know the difference between what happens in a game and the real world.\n\nUltimately, I think the best way to find out if video games are harming your children is to ask, “Is this still fun for you?” Children should be playing games because they want to, rather than because they have to. A child who is playing video games because they want to stay home from school, avoid a particular person, or because they cannot sleep, is probably a child that is playing for the wrong reasons. In those situations, parents should look at the reasons for playing, rather than the video games themselves.\n\nBlack: Know the games. Read up on the ratings systems — they're excellent. A young child should no more play an M-rated video game than he or she should watch an R-rated movie. If you find a game your child enjoys, play it with them. If your child is spending time with online friends, get to know these friends as you would their real life counterparts.\n\nBecome a trusted person with your child's gaming, not a \"person to avoid.\" The best effect of doing this is that you'll discover what Dr. Chow and I know from personal experience — gaming is fun, and children like it because it is fun.\n\nAlmost every time there has been a mass shooting in recent years, video games have been blamed, at least in part, at some point — sometimes even before we know whether the shooter even played games. Why do you think that is?\n\nBlack: The simple answer is that violence is complicated, and an easier answer is simpler to digest. It is so much easier to point at a video game and say, \"That's the problem,\" than it is to look at our own society, our own laws, our own views on mental health, and our own systems in fostering a healthy society.\n\nVideo games have achieved the status of \"moral panic.\" That is to say, that the narrative that people hold is that \"video games are not healthy, and are bad for our children.\" This is very similar to how television used to be viewed, how jazz music was viewed before that, how novels were viewed before that, and how Shakespeare was viewed before even that.\n\nThere has always been a moral panic that has us \"worried for the future generation.\" I think video games are so prevalent, and yet so foreign to parents and the older generations, that it's easy to see them as \"scary.\"\n\nVideo games have progressed from very primitive to very realistic, the M-rated games have become more violent, and the interactions more realistic. So people make this link that \"increasing violence is due to increasing use of video games.\" However, the world is not more violent. In fact, violence in youth continues to decrease year-over-year. So the core concern is unfounded, yet the media and public narrative remains.\n\nWhat can you tell me, from your own work in child and adolescent psychiatry, about the link between violent behavior and video games? Is there one?\n\nBlack: To be blunt, if there is a relationship, it looks like it is very small. Excellent scientific reviews of the literature (C.J. Ferguson has an excellent review here) have already shown that the existing research is tremendously biased, and doesn't actually show a lot of connection.\n\nThere are many contributions to violence — genetics, environment, social situation, abuse, education, etc., that video games likely rank very low on the list of contributions. Fortunately, the science is changing, and even some of the biggest names in the \"violence caused by video game\" camp are being forced to pivot to admit that, despite decades of research, there is very little evidence to suggest that real world violence has any significant relationship to video games.\n\nChow: I have seen violent behavior in people who play video games, and I have also seen violent behavior in people who do not play video games. That being said, it is becoming harder to find people who have never played a video game.\n\nAlmost everyone has played a game like 'Angry Birds' on their phone. Despite the proliferation of video games, I am not seeing any increase in violent behaviors in children. If someone wants to prove to me that video games cause violence, they need to explain why the incidence of violent crimes is falling in America while more people are playing video games.\n\nI am struck by how very many different studies there are regarding how violent video games affect those who play them. Some studies suggest they are quite damaging. Other suggest the opposite. In your experience, what is the “truth”? What can we take away from this cavalcade of studies?\n\nChow: I have attended conventions where tens of thousands of video gamers have converged on a city. The most recent example was the Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle (see video below). Something like 75,000 video gamers showed up. If video games, and in particular violent video games, create violent, antisocial people then you should expect that attending PAX would be one of the most frightening experiences in my life.\n\nIt was quite the opposite. I found people to be very friendly. They waited in long lines without fighting or cheating. They complimented each other on their gaming skills and costumes. They met up with each other for dinner. I felt safer at night because there were so many people walking around the convention venues ... I challenge the researchers who say that video games are harmful to explain that.\n\nBlack: To follow up on my point about a \"moral panic,\" one of the interesting things about the aspects of a moral panic is that only the research that confirms the panic ever sees the light of day.\n\nIn 2007, a paper published in the Journal of Pediatrics — The Public health risks of media violence: A meta-analytic review — showed that there is tremendous publication bias in the field of violence and video games. Quite simply, research that shows a negative or no relationship between video games and violence doesn't get published, while research that shows a strong connection is published.\n\nThe most striking example of why this research is biased comes from the populations they use. Many articles are published, using experiments run on college-age kids (students often in psychology courses, no less!), and yet their \"results\" are headlined as evidence for a link between children, violence, and video games.\n\nMany people worry that video games can be very isolating to those people — especially young people — who play them. Is that the case?\n\nChow: Video games have evolved into a shared experience. No longer are people playing these games alone in their parents’ basement. People expect to be able to play online. People join online communities populated by tens of thousands of individuals around the world. They participate in prosocial behaviors such as cooperative play, trading, negotiating, forming alliances, and creating rules of conduct.\n\nYou need to be able to get along with a diverse community in order to succeed in online play. Antisocial people are often marginalized and even banned from popular communities. If you told me that a child was participating in an activity where she was cooperating with tens of thousands of people across the globe to accomplish a shared objective, I would probably label that as prosocial. People playing video games are doing this right now.\n\nBlack: Dr. Chow is completely right here. Games are no longer black-and-white. There are few examples of a simple \"violent video game.\" Video games have moral lessons multiplayer objectives, cooperation, competition, and learning. Even some of the much-ballyhooed games have prosocial components. You can help others in shooting games, you can work together against a common enemy (in Call of Duty's case, zombies!), and you can communicate around the globe. There are problems that crop up from this, and there are real concerns, but video games are complicated now, and they would simply not be fun if there wasn't more to them.\n\nThe implication after these mass shootings is that video gaming is somehow not normal.\n\nChow: Video games are everywhere. People play them on phones, tablets, airplane entertainment systems, as well as the traditional Xbox and PlayStation. Revenues for the video game industry surpassed those of the movie and music industry years ago. Saying that video gaming is not normal would be like saying that going to a movie or listening to music is not normal. Almost everyone has played a video game. You can no longer separate video gamers and non-video gamers.\n\nBlack: A Pew Internet & Life Survey showed that 99 percent of American teenage boys and 97 percent of American teenage girls play video games. It is undoubtedly even higher now. Video gaming is a normal element of childhood now. Clinically, when I see children in my office, I don't ask \"do you play video games,\" I ask, \"What games do you play?\" Being knowledgeable about video games and having that connection with children amplifies my ability to relate to the children I see.\n\nInterestingly, we actually see that reflected in some of the disorders we see as well. For example, depression may actually be higher in children who play no video games or more than a few hours a day, than in children who play one or two hours a day. That isn't to say that video gaming treats depression — but it's now just a normal indicator of childhood function.\n\nYou have spoken before about how young people who struggle with things in “the real world” such as rewards, validation, mastery of skills will seek them out in video games. What do video games provide young people struggling to be successful in the real world? And is seeking that out in a game a positive thing?\n\nChow: Video games can provide a safe environment for people with several advantages over the \"real world.\" People can pause or stop a game if it becomes too difficult. They can modify the settings. They can try out new approaches to a task without fear of \"real world\" or permanent consequences. They can recruit a diverse array of fellow video gamers from around the world to help them with a troublesome area.\n\nIn many ways, video games are the modern equivalent of a children’s playground. They provide an area where people can play hard and try new things, but there is always a soft surface to land on if you fall. This sense of security allows people with challenges to come out of their shells and thrive.\n\nBlack: Children who overuse of video games may actually be turning to video games because it gives them something they are lacking. One of the core beliefs we have in child psychiatry is that children, generally, do their best to succeed. If they cannot succeed in \"real world\" activities such as socializing, or school, they may find the success they can attain in an online or video game environment to be preferential.\n\nThe parent who says \"my child plays too much\" may be focusing their attention on the wrong thing. A better question might be, \"what is causing difficulty in their life that makes play so preferential?\" Enlisting help in getting the answer to that question may be the intervention that creates true health for a child who overuses games, rather than simply removing the game and the one thing they find enjoyable.\n\nIn the wake of shootings like these, as video games are brought up as a cause, what do you think the biggest misunderstanding about video games is?\n\nChow: People like to label things as good or bad. It makes the world simpler. Unfortunately, most things are not so black and white. For example, we have heard plenty of news about storms and flooding in the past few weeks. You may be tempted to conclude that ‘water’ is a very bad thing. It destroyed people’s homes and business. It even killed some people. Fortunately, we are not hearing calls to ban water because people know that would be ridiculous.\n\nVideo games are the same. They are neither good nor bad. They can be both. We can choose as a society to encourage the prosocial aspects of video games, or we can make misguided efforts to curtail or ban video games.\n\nBlack: The biggest misperception these days is that only social isolates play video games, and that these games cause the types of problems that lead to violence. Video gaming is so prevalent that saying someone \"plays video games\" is akin to saying they \"breathe oxygen.\" Video gaming is normal. I like to think of myself as normal, I hold a number of jobs, I am married, and I regularly play basketball. I also play video games. I'm not an atypical gamer, I'm a gamer.\n\nIn moments when there is tragedy and we have so much thought and pause for introspection, it's so important to look at variables as \"contributors,\" not causes. It helps to prevent leaping to wrong conclusions. Investigations will be done and information will be discovered, but at the end of the day, there are so many complicated reasons that violence happens in the world, that we as a society need to look at all we are doing (laws, education, health, weapons, etc.) to ensure that violent acts are as rare as they can possibly be.\n\nWinda Benedetti writes about video games for NBC News.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00007-of-00064--788", "original_text": "It was Friday 12 June. The previous day England, without playing at all well, had beaten Czechoslovakia 1-0 to secure second place in Group C and qualification for the quarter-finals. All four ties were to be played on the Sunday, giving the team a couple of days off. Alf Ramsey decided that there was enough slack in his schedule to allow a little downtime.\n\nNot far from the Hilton, where England’s team was based, was the Guadalajara Country Club, a swanky golf course with tennis courts, swimming pools and swanky bar attached that apparently charged £1,500 a year – the equivalent of £19,000 today – for membership. Many English football figures, including Joe Mercer, Don Revie and a few players’ wives, had based themselves there for the tournament and the players had been demanding a chance to visit every time their coach trundled past. Finally Ramsey relented.\n\nEngland had brought much of their own food, their own drink, even their own coach to Mexico, but beer was safe enough. After all, back in the middle ages people drank the stuff all day because the alcohol killed all the nasty bugs that made the water unsafe. In the country club, the team ordered a round of beers. Someone gave one to Gordon Banks, and in that moment the holders’ grasp on the World Cup was broken. “I can’t remember if the bottle I was served was opened in my presence or not,” he wrote in Banksy, his autobiography, “but I do know that half an hour after that beer I felt very ill indeed.”\n\nThe winners of each group got to stay in their first-round base for the quarter-finals, while the runners-up were forced to travel. England were to play West Germany in Léon, a couple of hundred kilometres from Guadalajara. They wanted to fly, but were told that the runway at Léon’s airport was too small to accommodate their plane (strange, as it had been perfectly long enough for Germany to fly there). Instead the day before a World Cup quarter-final, the reigning champions were forced to take a five-hour coach journey, without the benefit of air conditioning. They would stay at the Motel Estancia, which the Bulgarians – now eliminated – had complained about during the group stages (and was also hosting the German players’ wives and girlfriends). Although England requested an alternative, and Peru had just vacated the preferable Guanajuato Hotel, they were told it was too late to change their plans.\n\nSo back in Guadalajara Banks “spent an uncomfortable night at the hotel, most of it being spent on the loo”, and then throughout the journey to Léon he was “suffering from terrible stomach cramps” and feeling “in imminent danger of being violently sick or something even more embarrassing”. Upon arrival he went straight to his room to get some rest.\n\n“The trouble was, I was being sick (or worse) so often that I was getting no rest,” he wrote. “This was no ‘normal’ tummy upset. I felt as weak as a kitten. My limbs ached; my stomach cramped. I continued to sweat and shiver as if I’d been pushed outside on a winter’s day wearing nothing but a pair of shorts. That night I spent more time shut in the loo than I did lying in bed.”\n\nHe was assessed by the team doctor, Neil Phillips – who wrote in his own autobiography that, contrary to Banks’ recollections (and Phillips, a prolific note-taker, should be a reliable witness), “he had slept throughout the afternoon, had suffered no further diarrhoea, was symptom free and feeling a little better”. Phillips visited him again the following morning (“he had slept well and was symptom free. I advised him to stay in bed”) but was then packed off to deliver the kit to the stadium. While he was gone Banks was put through a fitness test.\n\n“I’d seen Alf’s fitness tests before,” he wrote. “They were quite rigorous workouts and I knew that if I passed the test in reasonable shape, I’d be fine for our game against West Germany.” Banks was taken to a patch of lawn next to the hotel and asked to jog to a nearby tree. Having successfully done so, it was time for some saving practice.\n\nA pre-match team meeting was called which, because there was no other suitable venue was held in Ramsey’s bedroom. “I sat down on the floor by the door,” Banks recalled. “As Alf began speaking, I began groaning. The stomach cramps had returned and with a vengeance. I’d hardly eaten a thing and there can’t have been anything more to come. I felt dreadfully sick, my shirt clung to my body with my own perspiration, great beads of sweat formed on my brow then ran in rivulets down my face.”\n\n“The room was quite small and the entire squad was packed into it,” recalled Phillips in his book, Doctor to the World Champions. “It was very hot and stuffy, even though all the windows were open. During the meeting, Gordon Banks became dizzy and fainted. I took Gordon back to his room, decided he was not fit to play and advised him to remain in bed.”\n\nEngland’s squad included the goalkeepers Alex Stepney – who had won the European Cup with Manchester United a couple of seasons earlier, but whose only cap had been earned in a friendly against Sweden a week before that final – and Peter Bonetti of Chelsea. The Cat had played six times for England, all but one game a friendly, and conceded only one goal. He was told to prepare to play.\n\nIncluding pre-tournament friendlies against Colombia and Ecuador, England had played five matches in South America, and Banks had been on the field for every minute. Bonetti had played only once, in a second-string friendly against a Colombian club side. He had a little over an hour to prepare to face the Germans.\n\nAfter an hour England were 2-0 up and in control. Not, though, for long. The game turned in the 69th minute, when a Franz Beckenbauer shot from the edge of the penalty area bounced under Bonetti and into goal, and then before play was restarted Ramsey took off Bobby Charlton and brought on Colin Bell. The substitution was being prepared before the goal, presumably intended to save the legs of his team’s oldest player for the semi-finals, and Ramsey pressed ahead despite it. “I’d never felt so well,” Charlton later said. “I felt I could run all day, even though we were in Léon and 6,000ft up.” The Germans equalised six minutes later, Uwe Seeler scoring a freak backward header, and Gerd Muller added the winner in extra time.\n\n“It was such a strange game,” Alan Ball later said. “I have never been in a more one-sided international. We were so dominant there was no doubt we would win. We were 2-0 up and cruising. I couldn’t believe how easy it was. Then a speculative shot from Beckenbauer went under Bonetti and that changed the whole match. From dominating the game for 75 minutes we went on to lose it. It was spooky. Nothing like that ever happened to me again in my football career.”\n\nFor some, the match was won and lost by the managers and their use of substitutions, then something of a novelty. Helmut Schön brought on the winger Jürgen Grabowski in the second half, who proceeded to “run the bollocks off” (Alan Mullery’s words) the full-back Terry Cooper to devastating and decisive effect, while Ramsey’s had only a negative impact as Beckenbauer, having spent an hour struggling in Charlton’s shadow, was released.\n\n“In my own mind I was already on the plane home, but Ramsey made a tactical error in calling off Charlton, said Beckenbauer. “Beckenbauer had been looking after Bobby and suddenly he started to cause problems for us and the game went away from us,” said Cooper. “That was crazy as we were absolutely cruising it.”\n\nRamsey, never one to admit to errors or regrets, defended his actions. “I’ve never seen England give away such easy goals,” he said. “They were bad goals. No team – at least not one as strong as England’s – should lose a two-goal lead. The whole thing was unreal, a freak of nature. The England team played tremendously. For an hour, they were brilliant. The Germans were never in the match. If I could do this all over again I wouldn’t alter anything.”\n\nOne thing, though, was not disputed: Bonetti should have kept out Beckenbauer’s shot, and possibly Seeler’s header as well. “I thought Peter should have had it and indeed nine times out of 10 he would have,” Martin Peters wrote in his book on the World Cup, published later that year. “I am not blaming him, merely voicing my opinion, and I’m pretty certain that Banks, had he been there, would have stopped it.”\n\n“That first goal were a Weetabix goal,” an unnamed player told The Observer’s Hugh McIlvanney. “And the second wasn’t all that much. But you’ve got to feel sorry for Peter. Banksie seemed to have got over Montezuma’s on the Saturday night and he was playing about with the ball on Sunday morning. He was in the side and then keeled over at the team meeting and Peter was told he was in about half an hour before we left for the ground. No wonder he was a bunch of nerves. If he’d had a lot of the ball early on he might have sorted it out, but there was hardly anything to do before Beckenbauer stuck that one in. In that sort of situation goalkeepers have no chance to find their feet.”\n\nBonetti was so heavily criticised that at one point his mum was moved to write to a newspaper to ask them to stop being mean. He never played for England again. “I shall not be affected by what happened in Mexico,” he insisted that summer. “Good games, bad games – they are all the same to me. Once they are over I forget about them. That goes for that match against West Germany. I know there has been a lot of criticism about the goals I let in, but what’s the use of my continually worrying about it? Mexico is just a memory now.” Bonetti won the Cup Winners’ Cup with Chelsea the following year and retired in 1979 to become a postman on the Isle of Mull.\n\nFor some in the England camp, the manner of Banks’ illness, unlike the beer that caused it, was hard to swallow. What with Bobby Moore being arrested in Bogotá shortly before the World Cup on trumped-up charges of stealing a bracelet from a jeweller’s shop, the way the players were kept awake all night by rowdy Mexican fans banging dustbins on the eve of their crucial group game against Brazil while police stood idly by (the situation was so bad that at 4am some fans were put in England tracksuits and driven out of the hotel gates in the hope that the noisemakers would think the players had been evacuated and go home) and then the travel arrangements to Léon and their accommodation once there, some sniffed a conspiracy.\n\nOn his way home from the World Cup the Daily Telegraph’s football correspondent, Bob Oxby, stopped off in Washington to visit his cousin, the senator Stuart Symington. Symington told him – whether it was said in jest or in truth is unknown, though it does seem far-fetched – the CIA had been behind Banks’ bout of food poisoning, intended to remove from the tournament the only team considered likely to stop Brazil, where the political situation had been causing concern in Washington.\n\n“Somebody got at him,” said the striker Peter Osgood. “We all did everything together as far as food and drink was concerned. We all ate the same things, we were all on salt tablets and various other pills to protect your stomach, which is why it was so hard to understand.”\n\nCertainly a saboteur could hardly have chosen a better player to poison than England’s talismanic goalkeeper. “After the game I went looking for Alf and I couldn’t find him,” wrote Ken Jones, the veteran Daily Mirror football correspondent. “The players are flopped out by the pool. Eventually I find him in his chalet with Cyril Broderick [who worked for the travel agent Thomas Cook and was in charge of England’s travel arrangements]. Broderick was pissed and was under the shower in his tracksuit. And I walked in and there were these champagne bottles. I said to Alf, ‘I don’t know what to say’. He said, ‘Do you want a drink?’ and I said, ‘Please.’ And he said, ‘Pour it your fucking self.’ He looked at me and he said, ‘It had to be him. Of all the players to lose, it had to be him.’”", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nIt was Friday 12 June.

Did you just want to torment me by putting me in another situation where a man makes unrealistic promises and waves his arms while I have to smile and look unruffled, all the while living with the knowledge that somehow he was what the people of Michigan wanted, not me?

I think it is blue, but mostly it is whatever color your dreams are.\n\nSalinas: Senator Sanders, are you loving this weather?\n\nSanders: Thank you for asking. I sure am.\n\nRamos: Secretary Clinton, what about your emails? Who gave you permission to do a thing like that? Will you drop out of the race if you are indicted?\n\nClinton: Wait why am I getting these questions? Why aren’t you asking Bernie anything that remotely resembles this? Um, look, a lot of this was classified retroactively and we all know what that counts for. Remember when J. K. Rowling classified Dumbledore retroactively? A lot of people got quite upset about that.\n\nAt a debate hosted by The Washington Post and Univision in Miami, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton answered a question about her private email server and a potential indictment by saying, \"That's not going to happen.\" (The Washington Post)\n\nRamos: Senator Sanders, would you like to go after Secretary Clinton on this subject?\n\nSanders: No, thank you.

That was crazy!\n\nSalinas: Secretary Clinton, are you pandering to Hispanics with your stance on the pathway to citizenship — or some might say, hispandering?\n\nClinton: I refuse to answer this question on the grounds that the pun in it is too terrible.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00005-of-00064--778", "original_text": "When the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered a near-record collapse in 2008 401(k) plans went down with it. The drop led some to consider the volatility of the market and look for safer methods of savings. One option is to purchase annuities through insurance companies. Long considered good as gold, these investment vehicles provide continuous payment to retirees until the time of death. But our panel of financial analysts heeds caution when it comes to annuities. They say investors must consider their options and research the insurance companies before making a purchase, a good way to avoid placing a bet on a company that could become the next AIG.\n\nIn a way, deferred annuities are similar to consumption smoothing. They allow you to receive today's money in the future, plus accumulated interest. A 60-year-old woman who is unsure how long she'll live--like most of us--can use a deferred annuity to take money from a world in which she dies at age 75 and give it to her 92-year-old self.\n\nBut the contracts involved often restrict a buyer's future use. If you die young, your money is pooled and used to pay current installments of other buyers. So the risk lies in your lifespan. The longer you live, the better a gamble such annuities become.\n\n\"You lose if you die young, and you win if you live a long time,\" says Tom Davidoff, assistant professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California Berkeley. With most plans, your family is unable to recover the remaining payments once you die. If you wish to leave your children or spouses a pile of liquid money, annuities may not be the best option. \"The richer you are, the more you're interested in leaving money for your kids,\" says Davidoff. \"That doesn't happen with annuities.\"\n\nStill, annuities are a common form of retirement package, so it's important to understand which type is best for you. The problem is that annuities are often mismatched for costumer's needs, says Gregory Wood, founder of Securities Litigation, LLC. He says there's an incentive for brokers to sell annuities because unlike mutual funds, sellers receive the same sizable commission on each annuity sold.\n\nSo it's important to understand all the details of the contract you enter before you buy. Fixed annuities guarantee that your money will accrue at a minimum interest rate. Variable annuities invested in securities have the potential to earn higher interest on your payments but unlike fixed annuities, you can lose money. Both charge substantial fees for purchases.\n\nOne perk that has drawn consumers to variable annuities--you can defer your tax payments until you receive benefits--may not be as beneficial as it sounds, warns Gerard Klingman, president of Klingman and Associates. He says that with capital gains and dividends being taxed at rates lower than 15% it makes sense to invest directly in the market instead of through the annuity vehicle.\n\nGuarantees are important in what Ron Sloan, senior portfolio manager for Invesco-AIM, calls a safety-driven investor mentality. But although the predictability of some annuities is tempting, he warns that these guarantees are only as good as the company. \"Every now and then, you see these guys punching pretty hard, these insurance companies. So there's still a lot of doubt out there,\" says Sloan.\n\nSometimes this doubt is warranted, as there have been instances where insurance companies went belly-up--Equity Funding Corporation and Executive Life Insurance Co. are two examples. So even though a company may offer a competitive price, it may not be the safest place. And what good is an insurance firm that can't be depended upon?\n\n\"The average consumer didn't give a great deal of thought to the safety of some of the really big insurers,\" says Bernie McSherry, senior vice president of Cuttone & Co. \"But it's certainly out there now, and people should be aware of it.\"\n\nConsumers should check the credit rating, often through A.M. Best Company, of their potential insurance carrier. They can also check with the state insurance commissioner's office to see if a company has ever defaulted on its payments and to review complaint data and enforcement action history. Moreover, investors should diversify their annuities. McSherry recommends spreading annuity purchases among at least three or four providers.\n\nForbes: If you were a senior citizen planning for retirement, or even a younger person than a senior citizen, what sort of interest would you have in purchasing fixed annuities to guarantee an income? Is that a viable strategy? Does that remain viable when you're doing financial planning? Is that a popular one now?\n\nBernie McSherry: The guarantees are only as good as the companies that you're investing with. There's a huge amount of liability. The insurance companies are all under a great deal of pressure, because they're having trouble meeting their obligations going forward. And I certainly would recommend that people spread some of that risk around. I certainly wouldn't want to see anybody lock up all of their life savings with one insurance company, with one annuity provider.\n\nForbes: Would you recommend a couple of annuities? Do you think annuities are good plans provided you spread the risk?\n\nMcSherry: I think annuities are up to individuals to assess. But I certainly would spread it among three or four providers at minimum.\n\nGerard Klingman: The issue, too, with annuities is that it's a general term. And there are a lot of categories within that, from variable annuities to fixed annuities that pay a fixed rate, to lifetime income payment annuities. And each have different advantages and disadvantages and may fit in different situations. The interesting thing is, you know, a lot people are looking toward the lifetime guaranteed income type of annuities now.\n\nAnd they seem attractive because with the stock market being so volatile, the bond market being volatile, it seems attractive to go back to almost having a fixed retirement income like people used to get from companies in the old days. But I agree with Bernie, it's only as good as who's guaranteeing it. So, if you're going to take that, you have to really do due diligence in terms of who the company is and diversifying that risk, because it's not really guaranteed.\n\nRonald Sloan: Yeah, and you'll notice, actually, insurance companies have started to put that little disclaimer on the bottom of their ads in the paper recently, that guarantees are only as good as the insuring company itself, the quality, or something to that effect. You can find it online when you take a look at their ads.\n\nKlingman: I do believe that state insurance commissioners and, at some point, even the federal government has some interest in making sure that insurance companies can meet their contractual guarantees. If they don't, then there's a real issue of whether or not the insurance industry will even exist if they can't pay out payments or pay death claims or disability payments. But it still is only a guarantee from the insurance company.\n\nMcSherry: Is it just me, or does anybody else find it strange that the government hasn't responded to the TARP applications? Most of the insurance companies put in applications for TARP funds months ago, and they've not heard back.\n\nForbes: Why do you think that is?\n\nKlingman: I think that, and this is just speculation, I think that the government is hopeful that the existing programs they put in place will right the financial system to the point where they won't have to get to the insurance companies. Because when you come right down to it, basically, the insurance companies are investing in all these assets that have declined so dramatically, whether it be mortgages or corporate bonds of commercial mortgages or commercial real estate. So, I think they're hopeful that what they've already done will work so they won't have to go to that next step.\n\nMcSherry: Yeah, there are limited funds available. They're probably saving them for the banks.\n\nForbes: Have any insurance companies defaulted, that you're aware of, on their annuity payments or anything like that?\n\nSloan: I'm not personally aware of any specific ones. But, you know, every now and then you just open up your screen and you take a look and you see, you know, you see these guys punching pretty hard, these insurance companies. So, there's still a lot of doubt out there.\n\nKlingman: Yeah, the equity of a lot of these publicly traded insurance companies have dropped dramatically. I mean, they're still all making their contractual payments, whether it's life insurance or disability payments or annuity payments. Historically, there's been a limited number of insurance companies that, you know, have had significant problems.\n\nI remember Mutual Benefit in the late '80s, early '90s; also, Executive Life in New York around the time of the whole junk bond crisis in the '90s. But in almost all cases that I'm aware of the state insurance commissioners have gotten involved and have had another healthy company ultimately take them over or put them in receivership so that benefits were still paid.\n\nForbes: And, you know, we were talking about different kinds of annuities before, Gerry. You had talked about how there's fixed annuities, there's variable annuities. In the financial press variable annuities have gotten a lot of bad press. What's your opinion on that as a product? Are they still being sold at the clip they once had been? Is something that's variable not all that attractive at this point to people?\n\nKlingman: Our firm in general has believed for many years that the tax-deferral aspect of variable annuities, in general, does not overcome the higher expense and cost related to owning variable annuities. And the way the tax structure's been the last couple of years, with capital gains and dividend rates being 15% or lower, generally buying stocks through a variable annuity ends up converting what would have been lower dividends in capital gain income tax rates to ordinary income tax rates.\n\nSo, in general, we have not been a proponent of variable annuities. Having said that, there's some internal guarantees that some of them have. If we go into a higher tax rate on dividends and capital gains, it might make sense for some individual investors.\n\nSloan: I think one of the threads going through this conversation is just this whole idea of the mentality of investors right now. And that is security and safety and predictability is the driving force behind everything in today's world.\n\nForbes: Yeah. And what I mean really picking up, especially with something like an annuity is, if you want them, definitely don't put all your eggs in one basket.\n\nSloan: Yeah, like anything else.\n\nKlingman: I think you always have to look at the carrier, the credit rating of the carrier has always been something that's been important. I think it's just obviously become even more important with the current financial crisis.\n\nMcSherry: Yeah, I think the average consumer didn't give a great deal of thought to the safety of some of the really big insurers. It was never really an issue prior to this cycle. But it's certainly out there now, and people should be aware of it.\n\nForbes: Yeah, because people bought a lot of insurance, in not just annuities, but insurance in general, almost like a commodity. There are a lot of online insurance comparison sites where you can find the cheapest provider and thing like that. But it doesn't necessarily mean they are the best providers.\n\nMcSherry: Right. And we're seeing some very highly rated insurer or formerly highly rated insurers now being downgraded pretty significantly.\n\nKlingman: At the same time, there are a number of insurance companies, even, you know, mutual life insurance companies that have done reasonably well in a very difficult environment. So there are insurance companies that are weathering the storm.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nWhen the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered a near-record collapse in 2008 401(k) plans went down with it.

His mother was a healer and came from a long line of people who believed eating well was an investment in one’s strength. Even the colors of foods played a crucial part in the delicate equilibrium of mind and body health. Green fruits and vegetables (spinach, melons, parsley) invited hope, while yellow and orange produce (squash, persimmons, citrus) encouraged happiness. Anything black (for example, the bitter skin of an eggplant) should be avoided so as not to court misfortune.\n\nThe spiritual and nutritional significance of food for Iraqi Jews did more than inform my childhood decades later in New York City—it defined it. In our house, tahini masqueraded as dessert, romaine lettuce as an exciting snack, and cod-liver oil as a benevolent addition to a cup of tea. My father warned me of the dangers of white flour, mozzarella sticks, even cold water (it assailed the system). “Poison,” he called anything with refined sugar. Our apartment was a culinary freak show. Step right up and see the Tofurky, horsetail tea, and sea-kelp noodles: all items that warmed and strengthened the body, in line with the Iraqi-Jewish saying “Give him food so he can grow.” In America, my immigrant father had taken his traditions to a whole new level. In the face of frozen dinners, he became a crusader for health. For sprouts, soy, and seaweed.\n\nI was doomed from the start. Not only was I the only girl in my school with artists for parents, but I’d virtually never had processed foods—no grape jelly, fruit punch, cinnamon buns, deli turkey, or movie-theater candy. But I wasn’t stupid. Midway through kindergarten, I made my first grown-up decision: I wanted a Happy Meal. And I chose my friends (and their mothers) accordingly. The truth is, I do not remember the taste of that first Happy Meal or what special gift I found inside. But it kicked off my secret love affair with all things unhealthy.\n\nAs the years went on, there were stealthy trips to Chinese buffets, clandestine sides of deep-fried pickles, hidden cans of sprayable cheese. I lined up two sleepovers per weekend, based less on the quality of friendship than the quality of junk food in that family’s pantry. I became a gymnast, and when we traveled for meets, I told my parents to please stay home and rest, I’d go with another family. This is how I experienced every fast-food chain along the eastern seaboard. Plus, I discovered Marshmallow Fluff, Capri Sun, trail mix laced with chocolate-covered banana chips. Bad fettuccine Alfredo devoured on a subway platform during eighth grade gave me food poisoning so utterly horrendous that I told my father I’d been drinking vodka: obviously preferable, despite my age, to eating cream sauce.\n\n(MORE: 40 Classic Children’s Books)\n\nDuring my freshman year of high school, my father was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Unsurprisingly, his commitment to healthy eating took on a whole new meaning: a mortal one. He consumed not a drop of dairy, a sip of beer, or even an ounce of soy. While in college, I heard from my mother about all the cruciferous vegetables my father ate, the endless quantities of kale and tomatoes.\n\nPerhaps I should have reconsidered what I was eating—or at least given up my secret stash of doughnut holes in solidarity—but I didn’t. Instead I doubled down: Fifteen flavors of sugary cereals winked at me from across the cafeteria, and I, in turn, fell to my knees. I learned what a panini press could do to provolone. I discovered the frozen-yogurt machine. And the wonders of peanut butter on French toast. And kiwi-strawberry wine! There was only one line I never crossed: I never had a bite of red meat. (I was raised as a pescatarian.)\n\nIn retrospect, it’s clear to me that unhealthy eating during this time was a way of seeking refuge. I wasn’t a huge rebel: After my father got sick, I was careful not to fight with him or my mother. I wasn’t one to sneak out of the house or do drugs or slack off in school. They were the very best kind of parents, and I never wanted them angry with me.\n\nBut my father’s illness upended me. And so I ate sugary cereal and French fries. Epic amounts of French fries.\n\nAnd then something strange happened. It took six years of cancer, a stroke, a fall, chemotherapy, and lots of radiation, but my father’s taste in food changed. Drastically.\n\nDuring my junior year of college, my mother called me. “Your father just ate a steak,” she said. You can’t blame me for thinking she’d said something about his life being at stake; I needed her to repeat the words twice.\n\nWe didn’t need doctors, diagnoses, prescriptions for heavy doses of morphine, or even referrals to hospice care to tell us that this was the beginning of the end. My father’s sudden refusal to go near whole wheat and baby bok choy told us everything we needed to know. He was no longer himself. On good days, my mother fed him white pods of cream cheese and zigzags of lox on everything bagels, dilled lobster salad exploding from glistening toasted potato buns, and buttery apricot tarts. On bad days, he craved hot dogs, root beers, and fried chicken from a paper bucket—and so she fed him that, too. This is what he wanted, and this is what we gave him. When I slaved over a roasted—heirloom-tomato soup and put it to his lips (he was pretty far gone by then), he winced as though I’d tricked him into drinking cough syrup. I gave him a black-and-white cookie to win him back.\n\nWhen my father passed away, there were soda cans in the garbage beside his bed. There was a half-eaten box of chocolates beneath it. This was not the man I knew. And yet.\n\n(MORE: How Not To Apologize)\n\nNow that I am in my mid-20s, as a way of nourishing myself, or stacking the odds of health in my favor as much possible, or perhaps conceding to the argument my father tried to make through most of his life, I have taken on some of his ways: filling my body with the kinds of foods he would have been proud of (lentils, oatmeal, turmeric, hemp milk) and filling my bookshelves with the kind of literature that will teach me the food tips he would have bestowed himself. I’ve been seeing an acupuncturist, and when he told me, “No more dairy,” it felt like a punishment I’d been awaiting for years. I’ve even cut out gluten, refined sugar, and farm-raised fish. Junk food reminds me of someone my father wasn’t—and because I want to remember him only as who he was, as his best self, I won’t go near the stuff. I haven’t had cream sauce in years. Or soda. Or a doughnut hole.\n\nIn the end, of course, no amount of broccoli or garlic could have saved my father. But he was astonishingly healthy until he wasn’t—and that’s worth aiming for, too. More than ever, I desperately want to make him proud, as if he might be suddenly aware of all the times that I didn’t, somehow cognizant of each onion ring I ever tasted.\n\nAnd so whenever I order hot water with lemon at a restaurant, I feel as though I am honoring him. Every time I make my own green juice, I honor him. Every time I mash up raw ginger during cold season, wincing as I swallow it down, I honor him. If he can see me, I want him to see me roasting a platter of root vegetables, not wiping chicken-finger grease from my chin.\n\nMy father passed away three years ago. And the pain is lessening. I am starting to feel better. It might be time, or therapy, or Chinese herbs, or all the clementines I’ve been eating so diligently. Not to mention sweet potatoes, corn, and carrots: orange and yellow foods for happiness.\n\n(MORE: 5 Types of Friends Everyone Should Have)\n\n1 tsp butter (or more as desired)\n\n1 tsp olive oil (or more as desired)\n\n1½ cups long grain rice, well-rinsed\n\n1 cup red lentils, well-rinsed\n\nSalt and pepper, to taste\n\nFresh herbs such as mint or parsley\n\n1 onion, sliced into rings\n\nIn a heavy-bottomed pot, sauté onion and garlic in a thin layer of butter and olive oil until fragrant and tender.

Gill and Greenhough were among those emigrants.\n\nDUBLIN -- The tall ships looked majestic as they sailed into the bay — replicas of the masted, rigged vessels that once transported millions of emigrants from these shores.\n\nThe ships had departed from Liverpool, England, three days earlier, carrying descendants of Irish emigrants in a reverse voyage billed as an opportunity to \"Sail Home to Your Roots.\" A crowd on the docks cheered as they entered Dublin port and the crew unfurled a giant green banner with the words, \"Welcome to Our Gathering.\"\n\nThe May voyage was just one event among thousands taking place throughout Ireland, part of an ambitious yearlong tourism drive to boost the country's battered economy by luring its diaspora home.\n\nFive-year-old Callum MacCobb poses with his flag on Dublin docks as he greets the tall ships sailing into the port. The ships were replicas of vessels that once carried millions of emigrants away from Ireland to seek fortune elsewhere.\n\nBilled as The Gathering, the initiative is really multiple gatherings, large and small, ranging from the cultural and historic to the sporting, the quirky and the poignant.\n\n\"Bring them home. Treat them well. The Gathering is 'Project Ireland.' Do your bit,\" Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny exhorted fellow countrymen and women when the initiative was launched earlier in the year.\n\nIn every county, town and parish it seems that some group has taken his words to heart.\n\nHighlights include flagship events like a July 21 Riverdance extravaganza, in which 2,013 master dancers are expected to kick up their heels along the banks of Dublin's River Liffey and attempt to break the world record for step-dancing. The last record was set in Nashville with 632 dancers in 2011.\n\nPopular annual cultural events such as the Galway Arts Festival, the Cork Jazz Festival and the Dingle Tradfest are all incorporating \"gathering\" programs, as are big sporting events. Choral gatherings are huge. It seems like every little village or town is hosting a gathering and inviting choirs from Europe and the U.S. to join them.\n\nThere are busking gatherings and blacksmith gatherings, scientist gatherings and even an \"Evil Eye\" spiritual gathering in Donegal in August.\n\nThere are quirky gatherings to raise money for charity — for example the redhead convention in Cork in August. And bog-snorkeling, sheaf-tossing and welly-throwing (Wellington rubber boots) gatherings.\n\nThe goal, tourism officials say, is to tap into the estimated 70 million people who claim Irish descent worldwide and bring at least 350,000 additional tourists home.\n\nFrom around the world, they are heeding the call.\n\nA gang of London ex-pats has organized a bike ride from Trafalgar Square to Killorglin, County Kerry, in time for the annual three-day Puck Fair in August. Reputed to be the oldest fair in Ireland, the highlight is catching a wild mountain goat and crowning it King Puck.\n\nLegend has it that during the 17th century, a goat broke away from its herd to warn the town of the advancing army of English commander Oliver Cromwell during his conquest of Ireland.\n\nA group of Irish emigrants living in Toronto who, partly out of homesickness, organized a club there to play camogie, is returning as part of an international camogie gathering at the end of July. (The sport of camogie is women's hurling.)\n\nThe event includes matches in Dublin's Croke Park stadium, hallowed ground for the Gaelic Athletic Association, Ireland's biggest sporting organization.\n\n\"To come home and play in Croke Park is like a dream come true,\" said camogie player Marie O'Riordan, who emigrated to Toronto from Cork in 2009. \"It's a fantastic way for emigrants like us to keep the connection and be part of something positive for our country.\"\n\nBut The Gathering has its share of critics too, notably actor Gabriel Byrne, who spent two years as Ireland's cultural ambassador to the U.S. In interviews last year, he dismissed the initiative as a cynical government effort to \"shake down\" emigrants \"for a few quid.\"\n\nWhether the effort can draw enough tourists to dent Ireland's economic woes remains to be seen. Ireland has been in economic turmoil since the real estate boom collapsed in 2008. Unemployment stands near 14 percent and emigration is once again commonplace among the young.\n\nRegardless of the economic backdrop, there seems plenty of good will toward gatherings — gratitude even, that they are showcasing aspects of Irish heritage that might otherwise be bypassed by tourists.\n\nGlasnevin cemetery in Dublin, for example, is hosting gathering-related \"Family Weeks\" urging the numerous clans (O'Neills, O'Donnells, O'Briens) to start their gatherings with a walking tour of the cemetery and a visit to its unique museum. The cemetery staff is also offering expert help in tracing kin.\n\nThe gated 1832 cemetery with its soaring Celtic crosses and lush grounds (it was designed as a garden as well as a burial place) is a gold mine for anyone interested in Irish history. It was founded by Irish politician Daniel O'Connell (known as \"The Liberator\" for championing the right of Catholics to vote) and a giant round tower above his crypt dominates the grounds. Visitors can enter the crypt and stop by the graves of other historical figures including 19th century nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell (dubbed the \"uncrowned King of Ireland\"), and founders of the modern Irish state, Eamon de Valera and Michael Collins.\n\nThe great houses, castles and gardens of Ireland are also celebrating The Gathering with additional tours and lectures like the recent \"tracing your Wicklow roots\" talk by genealogist Nicola Morris at the Powerscourt Estate in Enniskerry, County Wicklow.\n\nWith stunning views of the Wicklow Mountains and vast ornate gardens reminiscent of Versailles, the 18th century estate (originally a 13th century castle) is often described as Ireland's most beautiful. The great house burned down in 1974 and much of the interior was destroyed; today there's a gift shop and cafe on site and visitors can spend an entire day exploring the grounds — over 47 acres (19 hectares) of formal gardens, sweeping terraces, statues, ornamental lakes and trails.\n\nSouth of Dublin, the Wicklow Mountains once provided a haven for rebels fighting British rule. Morris' lecture focused on their stories and on helping attendees trace their connections to some of the historical characters, Irish and English.\n\nWhile The Gathering has been a boon for her profession, Morris views it as more than just an economic initiative.\n\n\"There is a wonderful, grass roots nature to it all,\" she said. \"It's a mixture of history and culture and community spirit and just giving emigrants a great big welcome home.\"\n\nPerhaps that spirit is most evident in some of the more poignant gatherings, like a recent reunion of the so-called \"Forgotten Irish\" in the harbor town of Dun Laoghaire, seven miles (11 kilometers) south of Dublin. Hard times in the 1950s and 1960s drove thousands of young Irish to emigrate, catching the ferry to Britain in search of jobs. Many spent their working lives sending money to support their families in Ireland, yet unable to afford to return themselves. As part of The Gathering, a group of volunteers sponsored about 50 elderly emigrants on a weeklong visit home — a trip that included an emotional wreath-laying ceremony next to a plaque in their honor on Dun Laoghaire pier.\n\nHuddled in the wind beneath an Irish flag, they proudly sang the national anthem, \"Amhran na bhFiann\", and recalled painful farewells decades earlier.\n\n\"There were tears then and there are tears now,\" said Mary Carrick, 70, as she remembered the summer day in 1967 when she clutched her suitcase and waved to her parents as the ferry pulled out to sea.\n\n\"The Gathering,\" she said, \"is a wonderful way to remember our contribution and to welcome us home.\"\n\nTHE GATHERING: http://www.thegatheringireland.com/.

But how will he fare in his fresh feuds with fellow outsiders Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina? A week ago Trump said he hoped Carson would “hit” him, because Trump “love[s] to counterpunch.” Does he ever. Carson, who is gaining fast on frontrunner Trump in a new poll today, took a mild shot at what Trump’s self-described “big league” Christian faith. Pressed by reporters during a campaign stop in Anaheim, Calif., to respond to Trump’scriticisms that Carson isn’t qualified to be president, the retired neurosurgeon initially declined. But when asked to contrast himself with the New York billionaire, Carson responded, “…I realize where my success has come from, and I don’t any way deny my faith in God,” said Carson. Carson went on to cite favorite scriptures that “humility and fear of the Lord are riches in honor and life,” saying that he didn’t get “that impression with” Trump. That was a swipe at Trump who bragged that he likely hadn’t ever felt the need to ask God’s forgiveness. On CNN today, Trump unloaded on Carson: “Look at his faith and you’re not going to find so much. And you look at his views on abortion which were horrendous, and that’s I think why I’m leading with all the evangelicals. I’m leading Ben Carson by a lot I’m almost double his numbers.” “But I don’t know Ben Carson, perhaps – you know – an okay doctor…we’re not talking about a great – he was an okay doctor.” “And now, because he’s a doctor and he hired one nurse, he’s going to end up being president of the United States?” “For him to read from the Bible in his memory, it looked like it memorized it about two minutes before he went on stage.” But Carson isn’t the only target of Trump’s wrath. Businesswoman Carly Fiorina, who also gained ground on Trump in CNN’s poll out today, got a dose too.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone Trump mocked Fiorina’s appearance: “‘Look at that face!’ he cries. ‘Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!’ The laughter grows halting and faint behind him. ‘I mean, she’s a woman, and I’m not s’posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?’” Fiorina declined to respond in kind during an interview on “The Kelly File” saying instead, “I’m not going to spend a single cycle wondering what Donald Trump means. But maybe just maybe I’m getting under his skin a little bit because I’m climbing in the polls.” In a phone call to “Fox & Friends” today, Trump claimed he was not referring to her appearance but instead, “about persona.” But as Trump’s own comments to Rolling Stone make clear any disparagement of women’s appearances is a fraught subject for the GOP frontrunner. Trump did not, however, shy away from continuing to attack Fiorina’s record as a businesswoman and her qualifications to be president. Given the strong favorable views of Republicans voters towards Fiorina and Carson, Trump’s attack-dog approach with his fellow outsiders looks to be a much riskier gambit than his ceaseless trolling of the beleaguered Bush. WALKER JOINS FALL FASHION TREND WITH RE-BOOT AP: “Republican Scott Walker plans to talk about ‘wreaking havoc’ on Washington D.C. with a Thursday speech at the alma mater of former President Ronald Reagan. Walker's presidential campaign on Tuesday released excerpts of his speech to be delivered at Eureka College in Illinois. Walker is also expected to release weekly ‘day one’ promises that describe action he would plan to take on his first day as president. Walker has already said he will end the Iranian arms deal and propose repealing and replacing the federal health care law on his first day in office. The speech and weekly release of ‘day one’ promises comes as Walker is trying to regain ground after being among the top tier of Republican candidates, only to see his standing drop in recent polls.” [The Atlantic’s Molly Ball goes back to where it all began to look for Walker’s path forward: “For the past four years, Walker has dominated Wisconsin. His bold agenda shattered the status quo, he shocked the left and united the right, and he couldn’t be beat. Recalled in 2012, challenged in 2014, he kept on fighting and kept on winning. … For Wisconsinites accustomed to Walker’s dominance, his fall from glory nationally has been disorienting and out of character. Back home, he has always been focused, disciplined, on-message to a fault.”] Jeb gets a little Trump-y in tax plan - NYT: “Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida challenged some long-held tenets of conservative tax policy on Wednesday by proposing to curtail valuable deductions that benefit businesses and the wealthy and eliminate a loophole that has benefited hedge fund and private equity managers for years. That an establishment Republican candidate has embraced such changes not only highlights how income inequality has altered the tenor of the presidential debate for the party, but also indicates the ideological pull Donald J. Trump’s candidacy is having on the Republican field after he made similar proposals.” [Bush will talk about his tax policy and hold a town hall in New Hampshire today.] Koch group applauds - Conservative group Freedom Partners praised the GOP candidates who have come out with detailed tax reform plans. President Marc Short said in a statement, “We applaud Governor Jeb Bush, as well as Senators Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, for providing detailed plans to lower rates, reduce corporate welfare and simplify the tax code.” Freedom Partners supports reducing tax rates, and ending corporate loopholes. FEDS FILLET CHRISTIE’S REVIVAL USA Today: “The Bridgegate scandal, dormant for months, sprung back to life with a vengeance Tuesday – a day before the second anniversary of the bridge lane closures – for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and his struggling presidential campaign. United Airlines announced that its chief executive officer had stepped down, a casualty of the airline and federal prosecutors’ inquiries into the relationship between the company’s executives and the former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey… Two former Christie loyalists, Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, are scheduled to be tried in the fall on Bridgegate-related charges. David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official and high-school classmate of Christie, pleaded guilty in May... The fall of United’s CEO is the latest sign that prosecutors may be building a case in their spinoff investigation of David Samson, the influential lawyer who chaired Christie’s gubernatorial transition and later the Port Authority.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Of the many theories that exist about human evolution the latest find from explorers in South Africa proves to be the most revolutionary. National Geographic brings today’s biggest science story of two recreational cave divers stumbling upon a new species of human ancestor called Homo naledi. Steven Tucker and Rick Hunter found a cave outside Johannesburg looking for a new adventure in an area known for fossil discoveries, and research. Although much of the area has been trodden over, Tucker and Hunter were hoping to find a new path or a less-explored area. In a narrow cave, barely big enough to fit them through, they found they would be far from disappointed, discovering what appeared to be a vast collection of human bones. But how did this cave collect so many bones? Is it possible that this species buried their dead in some way? Check out this deep read for an account of their findings here.

THE JUDGE’S RULING: TWO WRONGS DON’T MAKE A RIGHT Though he believes that the decision to incarcerate Kentucky court clerk Kim Davis wasn’t the right course of action, Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano says Davis’s argument in refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples because of her religious convictions is flawed: “The Free Exercise Clause guarantees individuals the lawful ability to practice their religion free from government interference. It does not permit those in government to use their offices to deny the rights of those who reject their beliefs. That is the lesson for Kim Davis.” Read here.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00005-of-00064--379", "original_text": "Barack Obama's strategy to pass health-care reform seems based on a simple principle: Whatever Bill Clinton did, do the opposite.\n\nWhere Clinton and his team crafted their health-care reform plan in the executive branch, Obama has left the details of his effort almost entirely to Congress. Where Clinton pursued an ambitious reconstruction of the entire sector, Obama has sought to preserve existing insurance arrangements and win the support of industry players. Where Clinton spent a year developing his bill before even getting to Congress, Obama lashed his efforts to a tight (and apparently unrealizable) timetable. Even the atmospherics offer contrasts: Clinton's big push for reform came in a soaring 1993 speech before a joint session of Congress, in which he offered painstaking details of his plans; Obama made his argument to the nation at a news conference last week, addressing concerns more than specifying proposals.\n\nObama's reluctance to follow Clinton's example is understandable: Few legislative failures have been as catastrophic as Clinton's on health-care reform. Yet the ghosts of the early 1990s still hover over today's debates.\n\nMuch as opponents derided the Clinton effort as Clintoncare or Hillarycare, some now speak of Obamacare, and Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) recently chortled in a conference call that a defeat on health care would be Obama's \"Waterloo.\" The president, for his part, told PBS's Jim Lehrer last week that some Republicans are engaging in a 1994 redux. \"They explicitly went after the Clintons, said: 'We're not going to get this done.' . . . It was a pure political play, a show of strength by the Republicans that helped them regain the House,\" Obama said. \"I think there are folks who think that we should try to dust off that old playbook.\"\n\nYet there are aspects of Clinton's approach that could, and should, inform Obama's effort -- and not just as examples of what not to do. Clinton's attempt to remake health care may be remembered now as a moment of colossal hubris and epic political misjudgment, but his project was bedeviled by a greater sin: prescience. Clinton got the politics of reform wrong, but in important ways, he got the policy right. He just got it right too soon.\n\nBy the time Clinton and his team took office, the insurance market was changing. American consumers had traditionally relied on the most straightforward of insurance products: indemnity insurance. You went to the doctor or hospital of your choice, and that doctor or hospital sent your insurer the bill. Hopefully, your insurer paid it. That was that. The plans weren't confined to networks tangled in deductibles and co-pays. But they weren't holding down costs, either, and the system was becoming unaffordable. Managed care, a new system that was rapidly emerging, envisioned a more central role for insurers. After all, they were paying for your treatment, so why shouldn't they get some say in how it was conducted?\n\nThe managed-care revolution of the mid-90s was, by the early years of that decade, clearly inevitable; the financing and delivery of health care could not remain separate forever. But this was a dangerous change. Insurers make money by denying claims. Money they spend on health care is money they lose (they even have a name for it: the \"medical-loss ratio\"). Private insurance is a bit like a fire department that turns a profit by letting buildings burn down.\n\nSo Clinton sought to cage managed care inside managed competition, which would regulate the behavior of insurers and force them to compete for patients. This would give consumers more power against their insurance companies, drive the bad actors from the market and generally protect against the excesses of managed care. Clinton's plan also included a handful of other safeguards, like out-of-pocket caps and an independent appeals process, designed to protect consumers from deficient insurance.\n\n\"Clinton attempted to grapple with that change that was coming,\" recalls Sara Rosenbaum, director of George Washington University's School of Public Health and Health Services and one of the lead drafters of Clinton's bill, \"but to also make sure that there would be a higher power than just the market.\"\n\nBut if Clinton's team of enlightened wonks could glimpse managed care over the horizon, the public wasn't as farsighted. Bill and Hillary weren't seen as meeting and taming the managed-care revolution. The act of writing legislation that included managed care made it seem as if they were proposing it. And there was no political margin in that. Managed care, after all, means less choice. It means provider networks and insurance bureaucrats and complexity. It would have been a hard sell under any circumstances, but the Clinton administration's chaotic political operation and continual drip of scandals made the job virtually impossible. The plan died a painful and public death in Congress and contributed to the GOP's huge gains in the 1994 elections.\n\nBut then a funny thing happened: Managed care came anyway. By last year, only 7 percent of American workers were in \"traditional\" indemnity health plans, while the rest of us -- or at least those of us fortunate enough to have insurance -- were swimming in the alphabet soup of HMOs and PPOs and HDHPs. We're all in networks now. We don't get our choice of doctor. There's no appeals process. No out-of-pocket caps. Nothing to stop insurers from rejecting our coverage applications based on preexisting conditions. And if we don't like our insurer? Tough.\n\n\"We got managed care,\" says Chris Jennings, who was one of Clinton's top health-care staffers. \"But we didn't get the things that would protect us from managed care. We got the Wild West version of it.\"\n\nIn the modern health-care system, there is no higher power than the insurance market. And the insurers who populate that market have grown all the stronger. The Justice Department judges an industry \"highly concentrated\" if a single company controls more than 42 percent of the market. By that definition, 94 percent of statewide insurance markets are highly concentrated. A recent study by the advocacy organization Health Care for America Now showed that in Indiana, WellPoint controls 60 percent of the insurance market; in Iowa, Wellmark accounts for 71 percent; and in Alabama, Blue Cross/Blue Shield holds 83 percent. In the past 13 years, there have been more than 400 corporate mergers involving health insurers.\n\nEconomics textbooks tell us that concentrated markets reduce the competitive behavior that benefits consumers and lead to outsize profits for the dominant firms. Predictably, health-care premiums shot up more than 90 percent between 2000 and 2007, while the profits of the 10 largest insurers increased 428 percent over the same period. Clinton had promised us managed care within managed competition. Instead, the insurers took control of our care and managed to effectively end competition. Neat trick.\n\nThis has not gone totally unnoticed in the political system. In September 2007, a young senator lamented that the number of insurers had fallen by 20 percent since 2000. The senator? Barack Obama.\n\nAll of this has led to an interesting reversal in this year's health-care debate. In 1994, people feared that Clinton would restrict their choices. In 2009, people want Obama to bring their choices back. On June 2, Obama sent Sens. Ted Kennedy and Max Baucus, key players on reform, a letter laying out his \"core belief\" on a health overhaul: \"that Americans should have better choices for health insurance.\" He's tapping into something. A Washington Post-ABC News poll last month showed that 62 percent of Americans support the choice of a public insurance option. It's one of the most popular aspects of health-care reform. But if the public option would drive private insurers out of business and reduce consumer choice, the numbers flip, with 58 percent opposing it.\n\nWhat people support, in other words, is not public or private insurance, but choice in insurance. That, along with protection from escalating costs, is the inviolable principle of health-care reform.\n\nThe irony is that some of the health reform proposals on the table this year are a bit of back to the future. The health insurance exchanges that Obama envisions -- regulated markets that the government would set up where insurers would compete for business -- are the successors to the managed competition that Clinton sought. The regulations on insurer behavior and the out-of-pocket caps are direct descendants of the Clinton bill.\n\nThere are important ways, however, in which the bills currently working their way through Congress do not go as far as Clinton's plan did 15 years ago. In attempting to ensure that Americans can keep the coverage they like, they do not always ensure that people can leave insurers they do not like. The insurance exchanges, in particular, are limited to the self-employed, the uninsured and small businesses. Someone who works for a larger employer would not have any more choice under these proposals. Indeed, the problem with trying to make sure that everyone can keep what they have is that you can't change very much. This makes it hard for advocates to explain exactly how health-care reform will improve conditions for the insured, at least in the short term.\n\nMany in the White House say this is not a bug in the proposed system; it's a deliberate feature. The lesson of Clintoncare was that even if the American people want reform, they do not necessarily want change. And so Obama's health-care strategy involves a delicate effort to answer the question that doomed Clinton: How do you reform the health-care system without substantially changing it?\n\nBut this is not the early 1990s. The indemnity insurance that most Americans enjoyed then is virtually nonexistent today. The mergers and takeovers and consolidations in the insurance market have given people less choice and thus less power. Today, the cost issue is more acute, the president is more popular, the Democrats have more seats in Congress, and the Republicans are more fractured. Obama, in other words, was right to dismiss those who would \"dust off that old playbook.\"\n\nBut the ghosts still hover. Republicans are fixated on what worked for them in the last health-care battle, and Democrats are overly concerned with what contributed to their failure. Just as Clinton's plan was weighed down by the impression that it would change too much, history may leave Obama's effort vulnerable to the charge that it is changing too little.\n\nEzra Klein reports on domestic and economic policy for The Post and blogs at washingtonpost.com/ezraklein.

This is a distinct possibility. The break up of the UK will not be inevitable even if the SNP do dominate the parliament, but it will certainly make the political classes of Britain -- and perhaps of the U.S. and the main EU states too -- think hard about the point and value of the union to them. (Ironically, the elections will come just a matter of days after the 300th anniversary of the creation of modern Britain when the Scottish and English parliaments were merged in 1707.) Most people in England who think about these things assumed that the \"Scottish question\" had been dealt with when, as one of the first acts of the Blair government elected in 1997, it announced the creation of a devolved Scottish parliament with wide ranging powers over domestic matters. But disillusionment with the performance of that parliament (and the UK parliament in London), the long-standing belief that the English \"stole\" Scotland's oil and gas, and the postmodern temptations of identity politics, have put independence back on the agenda (a recent opinion poll found 51 percent of Scots favoring it). And a new front has now been opened up in the independence debate from the political right. Writing in the latest issue of London-based Prospect magazine, Michael Fry, a conservative Scottish historian, argues that the only way to revive the moderate right in Scotland and to better reflect the country's conservative Calvinistic soul is for former Tories like himself to back the SNP. If enough Tories heed Fry's advice it makes the likelihood of a SNP victory in May even more likely.\n\nThat would be bad news for Gordon Brown, the British chancellor, who should be taking over from Tony Blair as prime minister soon after those May elections. Brown, who is a Scot, is well aware that following devolution many people in England question whether it is possible for a Scot to become prime minister -- hence he has been making many speeches about the importance of Britishness. (Unfortunately for him Britishness continues to become less meaningful, especially to the Scots, as those things that helped to create and sustain it such as empire, world wars, Protestantism and the labor movement, fade from memory and importance.) If the chatter about full independence started to grow louder, as it surely would with an SNP-dominated parliament, that could cast further doubt on Brown's standing as an all-British prime minister. It might also tempt David Cameron's reviving Conservative party to finally cast themselves as an English party. Losing Scotland's 5 million people would not be a huge blow to England's size (more than 50m) and would not damage its main economic and cultural assets. But it would dent its standing in the wider world and might call into question things like the UK's permanent membership of the UN security council. More important it would be another depressing victory for tribalism. The Anglo-Scottish double act has been a rare example of successful multi-culturalism, with the moral earnestness of the Scots leavening the famous pragmatism of the English. On a more practical note, the Ireland model -- with its dynamic economy, and national self-confidence -- is increasingly popular in SNP circles. Yet Ireland looks far more like America than the social-democratic Scandinavian states that the left-wing Scots Nationalists admire. To emulate the Irish model, the Scots would probably need to cut public spending by one-third, not a good start to life as an independent nation.\n\n--- If you'd like to receive PostGlobal email updates, please click here and press send\n\nBy David Goodhart | November 21, 2006; 12:00 PM ET\n\nTrackBack URL for this entry: http://blog.washingtonpost.com/cgi-bin/mt/mtb.cgi/13405\n\nThe people of the United States decided long ago that they were better off without London taking decisions for them.\n\nWas that decision an example of tribalism? Or just the common sense choice for your nation?\n\nMr Goodhart writes from a peculiarly British perspective, but his is a very out of date view. Scotland's 18th century union may serve London well but for decades it has been bad news for Scotland. As part of Britain we have had the lowest long-term economic growth in the EU, with family incomes being squeezed, interest rates higher and wages lower.\n\nAnd at the same time as Scotland underperforms, similar neighbouring nations like Ireland, Norway and Iceland - all the same size, in the same part of the world and with similar talents and resources - are at the top of world wealth and quality of life league tables. Just last week the UN described Norway as the best place in the world to live, Iceland was second, Ireland fourth. Scotland as part of Britain had fallen 3 places to 18th. That is not good enough for my nation. We no longer want or need London remote control. Instead we want a new more modern relationship with the people of England as two equal nations, partners in much of what we do, but like Ireland, Norway or Iceland, free to prosper.\n\nThe readers of this blog in the USA know what it means to be free and able to make your own success.

That's why even die-hard opponents of Scottish Independence such as Michael Fry have now switched positions and are backing self-determination.\n\nGiven the current lack of willingness for a real contest for the leadership of the post-Blair British Labour Party within present members of the Cabinet, it may well be that Gordon Brown's inability to secure Labour votes at home may be what forces the hand of the Blairites to enter the contest.\n\nBut the article is simply let down by its ending. On current projections, Scotland has a relative surplus of 4.34 billion pounds compared to the UK and an absolute surplus of 1.01 billion pounds - not a bad start for any new country.\n\nAdd to this the potiential to grow the economy that full powers will give people in Scotland and it's understandable why the majority view in Scotland's business community is that have more powers will benefit Scots and the Scottish economy.\n\nPosted by: Jay Gee | November 20, 2006 06:00 PM\n\n\"To emulate the Irish model, the Scots would probably need to cut public spending by one-third, not a good start to life as an independent nation.\"\n\nReally? On what basis does the author make that assertion?\n\nWith North Sea oil revenues (75-90% in the Scottish area) keeping down the UK's borrowing requirement for the government's fiscal deficit how does it transpire that it is Scotland which would cut public spending?\n\nPosted by: Slim Jim Baxter | November 20, 2006 06:49 PM\n\nThis is far more complicated than just one parliament declaring independence.\n\nThe issues of a common Monarch between England and Scotland are the result of 700 years of wars and intermarriage.\n\nI doubt the current inhabitance of Windsor castle would be willing to give up the Scottish crown and remove the coat of arms of Scotland from their flag.\n\nAnd if they don't, then they are still one \"Kingdom\" no matter how much autonomy London gives them, and with that comes some sort of higher authority than they would have under an indpendant state.\n\nUnless they did something along the lines of what Canada and Australia have done.\n\nPosted by: Doug | November 20, 2006 07:18 PM\n\nI found the article interesting. I would think a federal system would take care of this problem, I'd guess the Scottish Parliament doesn't have any real authority then. A UK without Scotland is definitely weaker, whither then Northern Ireland? Would they attempt to hang onto Scotland? What then happens in Wales? At what point do you have negotiations on exactly where the borders would be? Would each section of Scotland have to approve it, or would there be a 'Southern Scotland' attached to England?\n\nPosted by: John Lease | November 20, 2006 07:23 PM\n\nWhat annoys me is the mis-informed suggestion that we want to keep our neighbours from hell!.A few comments you may find interesting: England needs to be recognised and treated as a unified country. Scotland and Wales have been recognised as countries and their people given the opportunity to vote in referenda for devolved government. Scotland now has a parliament, and Wales an assembly. In contrast, the people of England have been denied the opportunity to choose an English Parliament. Instead, England is being dismembered into nine regions. We find this discrimination unacceptable. England should be a political entity with its own parliament and executive. The immediate abandonment of the Barnett formula. The formula institutionalises discrimination against the people of England by ensuring that public spending in Scotland and Wales is far higher per head of population than in England. The Barnett formula diverts about Â£8 billion of extra public expenditure to Scotland each year. This means that the entire population of Scotland enjoys a subsidy averaging Â£30 per person per week. This has meant, for example, smaller class sizes in Scotland, higher pay for teachers, shorter hospital waiting lists, and the availability of prescription drugs and surgical procedures which are unavailable in England on grounds of cost. This unjustified discrimination must end. A new fairer system is needed which enables England's share of the Â£8 billion to be used to improve public services in England. Free the English....please vote for independance and take your politicians with you.\n\nDavid Ford Lane English Democrat\n\nPosted by: David Ford Lane | November 20, 2006 07:32 PM\n\nGoodhart misses the point spectacularly when it comes to comparisons between Scotland and Ireland.\n\nScotland does not have the economic problems which Ireland had until the late 1980s. In running a large relative budget surplus to the UK thanks to strong oil and corporation tax revenues, an independent Scotland could emulate Irish corporate tax cuts without risking a budget deficit.\n\nOf course, as part of the UK, Scotland has fewer powers over her economy than the state of Rhode Island. That's why Ireland is stealing a march on Scotland, and why she will continue to do so for so long as Scotland is shackled to the economic policies deemed most appropriate for the well-being of the City of London.\n\nIs it pedantic to point out that 'England's size' is, well, England's size, regardless of whether Britain remains intact or not? And as for independence meaning 'tribalism', I'm sure people like Goodhart were making the same very arguments when the Baltic States won freedom from the Soviet Union, and when the Austro-Hungarian Empire disintegrated.\n\nTruly, in David Goodhart, the Habsburgs are alive and well, and chattering round a dinner table in Hampstead.\n\nPosted by: Richard Thomson | November 20, 2006 07:37 PM\n\nIndependence for Scotland wouldn't be \"another depressing victory for tribalism.\" Empires that were assembled at gunpoint/swordpoint (UK, USSR, the Austro-Hungarian empire, Yugoslavia) aren't legitimate and are likely to unravel. If after all this time the Scots don't feel like they got a fair deal from the Brits, we should support their right to self-determination.\n\nPosted by: Irish American | November 20, 2006 07:37 PM\n\nI am glad to see England face this SCOTTISH SYNDROME and to see how Englishman handle it.

Scots recieving a raw deal from Brits? I think your getting your labels mixed up. Currently Scots are Brits, just like the English are Brits. It's a common mis-conception that Brits = just the English. It referes to anyone who comes from the British isles. Most of the UK's powerful cabinet positions are controlled by Scottish MP's who weren't voted for and are unaccountable to English voters. Imagine if Canada and the US where unified but Canada called all of the shots from Washington and none of it's Senators where voted for by US citizens, and you get an simplified idea of the current state of play in the UK. Scotland is welcome to it's independence and the quicker they vote for it the better I believe it will be for the English.\n\nPosted by: Anglo-American | November 20, 2006 08:07 PM\n\nWith a Scottish Stuart ancestor on my mother's side, I like nearly all of us have been inundated with Scottish nationalist hero stories from Robert the Bruce, to Bonnie Prince Charlie and William Wallace. The Romans built Hadrian's Wall to keep the barbarous and wild Scots out of Britannia. The Scots are never satisfied and I suspect that if they break away from Britain, they will soon devolve into fighting amongst themselves as they did before the Romans and the English tried to \"civilize\" them. As with the Quebecois in Canada, the British should divest themselves of these atavistic tribes and move on.\n\nPosted by: Jon A.

Lord Barnett arbitrarily decided that, per capita, Scots, Welsh and N. Irish residents should have more money spent on them than on English residents. 3. Scottish MPs at Westminster voted yes to legislation that brought about tuition fees for English university students, Knowing that their counterparts in the Scottish parliament had voted to give Scottish university students a free education. 4. The English NHS deprived English patients of life saving drugs, knowing that these drugs were available to Scottish and Welsh patients. 5. The elderly residents of England were forced to sell their homes in order to pay for social care, for the elderly Scots it was free. 6. When MPs elected to Westminster by Scots voters could vote on purely English matters but had no say in the affairs of their home country and were unaccountable to the English electorate. There is plenty more where that came from but from this sample alone, who can dare say that there is unity of any kind between the erstwhile constituents of the United Kingdom. I say good luck to the Scots in their bid for independence, they will not be the only country set free.\n\nPosted by: Patrick Harris Portsmouth | November 20, 2006 08:22 PM\n\nIt's a great piece. I particularly like Goodhart's description, \"the moral earnestness of the Scots leavening the famous pragmatism of the English\"- who knew such generalities could be substantive.\n\nThe 'British Question' has plenty of idiosyncrasies, but if you survey the forest accounting for the vagaries of its trees, it shares remarkable similarities with the tens of dozens of other 'tribal' antagonisms afflicting the old world. Each side has its blood boiling narratives and pride, each is inextricably tied to the other by myriad dual loyalties, mixed blood, shared religions and traditions. To the extent that blunt force political and institutional segregation is the answer to such problems, I wonder if it doesn't bode poorly for the future and the growing global propensity to reduce conflict to perceived ethnic, national and religious differences.\n\nPosted by: Dan | November 20, 2006 08:34 PM\n\nif scotland gained independenc it would be annexed faster than you could say United Kingdom.\n\nPosted by: Numan | November 20, 2006 08:39 PM\n\n\"United Kingdom\" indeed.

Cooperation where it works can be easily negotiated between neighbors, forced activities by a National group just breeds resentment and does not contribute to the good of the peoples involved. This idea relates to all of the groupings of the European nations, and the disUnited States would be a much better citizen of the world if its component parts were independent.\n\nThe UN could morph into the World Federation with Continent size sub units.

Law, not might, governs the affairs between peoples in Europe.\n\nUnder the tent of the European Union, there is more ethnic self-determination everywhere. The Irish government, for example, was only able to cooperate with London when the European Union guaranteed that law, not coercio, governs the relationships between states. That laid the foundation for ending the terrorism in Northern Ireland.\n\nLikewise the European Union provided groundrules to defuse ethnic conflict and devolution in Spain. Even unitary France is granting regions and peoples more autonomy. Belgium has become a federation between a Walloon and a Flemish state.\n\nThere will be few draw backs to Scotland going its own ways. Like Dublin, Edingburgh and Glasgow will move from the British periphery to European centers once Scotland is independent.\n\nAs Iraq demonstrates the limits of Anglo military might there is no reason to remain the appendix of England.

England has tremendous internal social problems regarding race relations; basically, immigrants from the countries formerly colonized are arriving in England en masse, and neither the healthcare nor education systems are capable of handling the challenges. Immigrants are set apart from the mainstream population in cultural enclaves. Perhaps there are cultural reasons the Scots are looking for a divorce from England; from my experiences interacting with English institutions, it is clear to me that England as a society still suffers from the need to promote homogeneity...even more so than where I grew up in the deep South.\n\nPosted by: Anita | November 20, 2006 10:43 PM\n\nDanny boy, there would be no woods or trees to worry about had the European Union not decided that, for the purpose of easier governance, the UK should be divided into 12 regions (Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland were the first 3, stealthily disguised as a means to enhance democracy by de-centralisation). This has exacerbated the problem that you highlighted in your post. Instead of 4 countries getting along, quite nicely, thank you, for the last 300 years there will be 12 \"regions\" vying for the best deal, causing 3 times the amount of rivalry and jealousy, 12 \"Regional\" governments scrapping for the crumbs dispensed by central Government who in turn will be scrapping with 28 other EU countries for the crumbs dispensed by the (unelected and unaccountable) EU commission.

The bonds are too complicated, there are too many people with roots and loyalties on both sides of the border and it's in the interest of too many people, on both sides of the borders, to stay the same for it to actually happen. A vote for the SNP is not in practical terms a vote for independence and if there was a referendum on independence it would fail.

Cutting public expenditures drastically and devise a investment oriented fiscal policy away from the past.\n\n2. Encourage savings less on consumption.\n\n3. Invest more on R&D and Technical Education.\n\n4. Have a balanced budget and float its currency for first 5 years.\n\n5. Provide basic health care to its citizens. The above is a very tall order and would be a great challenge to Scots to shape up or take a cut in their standard of living Taking over some of the National Debt would involve a rancorous debate. In final analysis, the cost of separating would be enormous even with North Sea Oil revenues.

You would never have had an empire without us\".\n\nThe answer is \"none\", the overwhelming majority, 92%, of the Army is English, the lowest ratio it has ever been is 89% English. The Scots like most of England's psuedo-celtic neighbours are imbued with a passion for victinhood and a propensity for never letting the truth get in the way of misrepresenting history.\n\nThe dependency culture and victim paradigm of Scotland is only matched by their ability to self publicise. England would be well rid of Scotland and its over reliance on English taxpayers and access to our markets, cut from the coat-tails of English enterprise the heavily subsidised Scots would then find their true level amongst the worlds economies, (nowhere to be seen) as a Disneyesque theme park where American tourists can see a nation balance a giant chip on each shoulder. The Scots economy is reliant on public (ie English taxpayers) expenditure as now 1 in 4 Scots are employed by the state, hardly the profile of a dynamic nation, it has ever been the case. If parochialism, envy, ingratitude and bitterness were national commodities then truly the Scottish would be a wealthy nation.\n\nPosted by: Anglo-Saxon Steve | November 21, 2006 06:57 AM\n\n\"The Scots economy is reliant on public (ie English taxpayers) expenditure as now 1 in 4 Scots are employed by the state, hardly the profile of a dynamic nation, it has ever been the case.

That's why I support independence. And you sound pretty bitter yourself, as do many of your English compatriots in this thread. Indeed, I am tempted to go so far as to describe you all as \"whingeing.\" Now where have I heard that word before?\n\nTo refute a few of the points you make :\n\n\"it has ever been the case.\" Nope. In fact, Scotland was the motor of the industrial revolution. Its economic woes are of recent vintage.\n\nAs for the excess public expenditure, it is more than made up for by oil and gas revenue you steal. I love you English. You take all the money from our oil and gas, throw a few coins back to us on public expenditure, then whinge about how we get a little more public expenditure than you do.\n\nAnd the Barnett formula was originally proportionate to population. It only became slightly disproportionate in Scotland's favour because Scotland's population size, relative to the rest of the UK, continued to decline - this decline being a consequence of the poor economy which, in turn, is a consequence of our membership of the United Kingdom.\n\nPosted by: Paul G | November 21, 2006 07:35 AM\n\nIt is not just the SNP who supports Scottish Independence. The organisation which I am Secretary of,- The Scottish Independence Convention, is an all party/non party umbrella group formed to advance the cause of Scottish independence, and to promote the case for independence within Scotland and beyond. Our Chairman is Murray Ritchie, a much respected former Political Editor of the Herald newspaper. We provide a forum in which people, parties and organisations in and beyond Scotland can cooperate in advancing this cause; We believe Scotland as a nation is entitled to self-determination and to become an independent state when the people of Scotland vote for it by a simple majority in a referendum. The problem we have is that our supine media for the most part will only promote the case for the union. Had they supported independence we would have been independent now. But things are changing and more and more are beginning to realise that independence is now a distinct reality.

Now the powers that be, seek to force unity on a collective of diverse ethnicity and religion, left to our own devices I think that relations would have naturally developed to be more than cool and cordial, I hate to think what would happen should there be a collapse in world economy or worse still a global environmental castastrophe. the rush for the door would make WW2 and Jugoslavia seem a picnic.\n\nPosted by: Patrick Harris Portsmouth | November 21, 2006 11:18 AM\n\nIf some of these more recent posts are anything to go by it will be a messy divorce! As for squabbling over what's left of the oil and gas, if Scotland were to actually become independent the original maritime borders would surely have to be re-instated. They were ofcourse moved for the benefit of the Scots nationalists some years ago. According to international convention much of the oil and gas reserves therefore rightfully belong to England.\n\nI would love to see the Scots vote SNP but I can't help thinking that the 51% figure is no more than 'talk' and when it comes to the crunch they simply won't have the nerve.

Its not an equal union as Scotland with 8.6% of the total UK population is very much the junior partner. For example: Scotlands economy suffers when Interest rates are increased to prevent overheating in the SE of England.\n\nAlso it should be noted that Scotland with 8.6% 0f the UK Population actually contributes 10.41% of all UK Government Taxes and revenues. In effect Scotland actually subsidises the rest of the UK. This is the main reason the British Government are resisting the growing demand for Independence.\n\nIndependence would actually free Scotlands entrepreneurs, businessmen, artists and creative people to build up a dynamic, vibrant and forward looking economy, which like Norway can offer the best of public service to her people.

For hundreds of years, Scottish law has applied on one side of this border, and English law on the other. Since this is one of the clearest and least disputed boundaries anywhere in the world, there would be nothing much to \"negotiate\" about. \"Would each section of Scotland have to approve it, or would there be a 'Southern Scotland' attached to England?\" - Answer, the South of Scotland is intensely patriotic. Every part of Scotland will vote unambiguously for independence. You are making the mistake of thinking that the Irish precedent is relevant. It isn't. There are no \"Six Counties\" in Scotland, nor five, nor four, no, not even one, which would choose to remain with England when the rest of Scotland becomes independent. Will Smih says \"Independence for Shetland and Orkney!\" - but they don't want this, they just want a substantial degree of autonomy within Scotland. When a referendum is, at long last, held on independence for Scotland, the majority of Orcadians and the majority of Shetlanders will vote in favour, the same as the majority of Scots as a whole.\n\nPosted by: Dave Coull | November 21, 2006 03:21 PM\n\nIsnt it funny that the English posters on here always go on about Scotland splitting up...well I say to you...all areas voted for devolution so all areas would vote for independence...If your country (England) is going to be split into regions..then that is up to you...we in Scotland don't particularly care what England decided to do to themselves..... as for the barnett formula where the English Democrat party want it scrapped...you dont want it scrapped more than us Scots..we want independence and anyone who says we should have a federal system...No it would be the same thing as now - no change and no chance.

The fact is that this would be a benefit for both Scotland and England - both would be free of their 'ever-whinging neighbour'.\n\nFrom a Scottish point of view (well I am Scottish) we would retain our oil and also be free to create positive social conditions focussed on Scotland rather than the south east of England. We would also be able to opt out of illegal, unnecessary wars. I also believe it would give England a new lease of life and they could finally find their national identity - at present that seems to be defined by wearing an English football strip.\n\nMany of the English posters on this forum argue that they are run by Scottish MPs. I think you would have to stretch your imagination a long way to find a Scot who defends the Union and Britishness with as much vigour as Gordon Brown (apart from perhaps a few Rangers fans). And Tony Blair, Scottish, don't make me laugh.\n\nThe simple fact is that Scottish independence is going to happen, like it or not. No party stays in power forever, and when Labour have had their day at Holyrood the SNP are the natural successors - Scotland has traditionally been a left-wing country and the SNP are the only major left of centre party still in existence, despite what Labour councillors would have us believe. It could be next May, it may not be for another 10 years but it is going to happen. As mentioned, one poll noted that 51% supported independence. But this poll had other interesting points to make:\n\n1. 10% were undecided, so 51% was the very minimum 2. Huge chunks of the other parties' voters (even the Tories) supported independence\n\nPosted by: Craig | November 21, 2006 03:35 PM\n\nAs an active member of the SNP, I always despair when I read my fellow nationalists falling into the trap of believing that we have somehow been hard done by by the English - I would argue that the vast majority of the English establishment (bar the likes of Samuel Johnson) , from 1707 on, has done a very good job of accomodating us, and making the best use of our people. Anytime when we have had a raw deal out of the union, there have been Scots standing alongside these so-called English oppressors.\n\nScotland's problems compared to Englands are purely demographic - 5 million people up here are always, always going to be of less import to a British government than the 25-30 million living in the South East of England. We do badly because we are a remote satellite state, not because there is considerable English ill-will towards us. Those who try to say otherwise do the movement a great disservice.\n\nSome Scots have, and will continue to get a good deal out of the union - the problem is that very few Scots in fact do today. While it may be a force for good for all the 'Scottish Raj' media commmentators, (Wark, Marr et al) the union, and its resultant demographic problems, do not benefit the vast amjority of Scots.\n\nAnd finally - what to fear of an independent Scotland, freed from its remote orbit round the London axis, able to turn itself to face the world, knowing that it may not be able to tip the balance in Iraq, but that it could make its positive contributions similar to those of Norway, which consistently 'punches above its weight' internationally with its leading positions on the Israeli-Palestinian and Sri-Lankan conflicts? Freed from the burden of power politics, Scots could go on and fill positions in international organisations that will more than compensate for any loss of a seat on the out of date UNSC.\n\nPosted by: AlenWatters | November 21, 2006 03:53 PM\n\nJust a few notes about this supposed preponderance of English people in the UK's armed forces. You may be right, which makes the use of Scots as cannon fodder all the more disgraceful.\n\nA few examples; Scotland has under 9% of the UK's population, but 18 of the first 100 (that's 18% in case you don't understand) UK personnel killed in Iraq since the 2003 invasion were Scots. During the First World War no European country lost a higher proportion of its population than Scotland, except for Turkey. In Turkey's case it was disease which carried them off, for the Scots it was ordnance.\n\nin 1759 General James Wolfe died while capturing Quebec. He famously remarked of his Highland troops \"They were hearty, intrepid, accustomed to a rough country and no great mischief if they fall.\" From before that day to beyond this one that has been and will remain the attitude of the UK's leaders to their Scottish troops; no great mischief if they fall, i.e. expendable.\n\nPosted by: Neil | November 21, 2006 03:59 PM\n\nA lot of the article seemed aimed at the pesky Scots going all tribal and breaking up England oh sorry Brtain the best superstate the world has ever seen, yeh right. Read the amount of comments from the English up above, a lot of them do not want Scotland either, but I don't see them being branded small minded or tribal.\n\nThe day that Scotland achieves its independence is coming fast, maybe America should remember its struggle in gaining independence and the important part that Scots played in that. An independent Scotland will be open for trade and relations with America, might be an idea for America to stay out of this debate and let it happen itself. The land of the free sounds nice, but does not fit America well if it is influencing things to Englands benefit.\n\nPosted by: Friseal | November 21, 2006 04:07 PM\n\nBill Conor - you are full of it.

It will be the countries invaluable right to do so. As its pointed out, it will be ironic that this would come on exactly 300 years since the act of Union that unified the parliaments of the Kingdom of Scotland to the Kingdom of England to form the Kingdom of Great Britain (the crown was already unified about 100 years previously). It was evident from day one, that the union was slanted towards England, anyone who has read the 1707 treaty, can see this. At the time it was unpopular with the Scottish population, but with corruption rife in the political and noble classes, it was a done deal. 300 years later we have the pro Unionist politicians promoting the lie that is the UK, espousing that Scotland is better off, that Scotland gets more than it puts into the UK treasury, ignoring the fact that Scotland actually contribute more through taxes and the oil wealth, than it actually gets, a fact that's often denied but cannot be ignored. It's a shame that David Goodhart gave away his English right wing credentials at the end of his piece. He should have pointed out that in the event that the union is dissolved, politicians like Gordon Brown, Dr John Reid and the current speaker of the House of Commons would no longer be MPs in England. Also David Goodhart failed to state that if Scotland dissolved the union there would be no United Kingdom, but a Kingdom of Scotland and a Kingdom of England, just as it was before 1707. I, for one hope that Scotland will make the right decision (without interference from foreign governments, has been the case recently with the US Vice Consul to Edinburgh) and become an Independent Kingdom once again. Following the model of Norway, Iceland or Norway, who are similar in size and economies, will be good for the country.\n\nPosted by: Edward | November 21, 2006 04:29 PM\n\nThere are no controversies about the LAND border between Scotland and England, but John G. says \"if Scotland were to actually become independent the original maritime borders would surely have to be re-instated\".

OF COURSE the British government didn't change the maritime borders \"for the sake of the Scots nationalists\". Turkeys do not vote for Christmas! The truth is completely the opposite, the British government moved the maritime boundaries further NORTH so that, if Scotland should become independent, more of the oil and gas would be in the English sector.

The British Monarchy has ceded too much to be called more than a tourist attraction. I offer for example the Queen's Speech. This should be an address by the PM. A Sovereign Queen would have never gone along with the Tory program when they committed such abominations as the reversal of the right of self-incrimination. The Monarch must be the conscience of the nation or it has no purpose. Perhaps the Glorious Revolution was not so Glorious after all. As a Plantagenet, I do not recognize its full implications and do not support anyone holding the crown who does. I also think that an independent Scotland has a better claim of union with Northern Ireland than England does, at least ethnicly and religiously.\n\nPosted by: Michael Bindner | November 21, 2006 06:56 PM\n\nFor auld lang syne, my dear, For auld lang syne, We'll take a cup of kindness yet, For auld lang syne!\n\nPosted by: | November 21, 2006 06:58 PM\n\nIf the author of this editorial is to be blamed for condescending to a nation of people as if they were seeking to become a \"boys only club\" then he can be excused perhaps by pop culture.

If a country with centuries of on and off self rule finds itself more inclined to be self-ruled once again, then it has the right to seek it. Furthermore why should Scotland share its monies with England when it could far more efficiently and effectively govern itself after the model of high-living-quality countries like Iceland, Denmark, New Zealand, etc?\n\nA low population and a high tourist trade, as well as a movement towards environmentally friendly industry and energy production make for an ideal country.

The Court said that if a clear majority of Quebecers vote for independence, then the rest of Canada has a duty to negotiate the terms of that independence in good faith. Sounds simple, but the devil would be in the details. How is the national debt divided? If the population in certain geographical areas do not vote in favour of independance - are they forced to separate? How are land borders determined - do you give effect to original historical boundaries or to subsequent revisions in those boundaries? How do you divide up the armed forces? What about the national currency - can they still use it? How do you deal with and divide common business and legal issues such as terms of trade, securities regulations, and taxation?

It shouldn't. The two are totally different. Scotland has a long history as an independent kingdom. Quebec is merely the remnants of the French colony of Canada. There is no \"language problem\" in Scotland. While Gaelic and Scots will both be encouraged, nobody who has any chance of getting into power in Scotland is going to try to force any language down our throats (unlike in Quebec). Scotland has a clear, well-defined land border. Quebec's boundaries would be certain to be disputed in any bid for independence. Scotland has a population which is remarkably homogenous by international standards. There is no \"Six Counties\", or even five, or four, or even one, there is no region of Scotland which will seek to 'opt out' if the nation as a whole chooses independence. In Scotland, while we have strong regional identities, there are no native national minorities with their own national territories. In Quebec, there are thirteen different native-Canadian nations with their own national territories. All thirteen of the native-Canadian groups of Quebec have made it clear that, while they can just about put up with French rule while Quebec is part of Canada, they will secede from an independent Quebec. The territorial claims of the thirteen native-Canadian groups that say they will secede from an independent Quebec amount to over fifty percent of the land area of Quebec. Quebec has already had numerous referendums in which independence lost. Even if there should be a referendum in which the independence option should win, this is certain to be hotly disputed. By contrast, we in Scotland have not had a single referendum, but, when we do finally get one, independence will win easily, and this will be accepted without dispute by the unionist minority, for the simple reason that they are, first and foremost, Scots.\n\nPosted by: Dave Coull | November 21, 2006 08:08 PM\n\nI know only one fact and that is that the Scott's are the most intelligent people in the world (10 of the 100 most famous people are Scotts!)

The revenue stream from that is only likely to grow - it is after all averaging around $20bn this year, with higher forecasts for the immediate future. Most economic surveys suggest that there is at least 20 years of significant deposits still left.\n\nThe cornerstone of economic policy for an independent Scotland is shedding the parasitic union, that drains Scotland of its wealth, its people and its rightful prosperity. A one-sided economic relationship that keeps the SE of England in the pork barrel and the rest dependent on them for crumbs? Does that sound like a successful relationship to any decent minded person here?\n\nWith Scotland's identified potential as one of the global powerhouses of GREEN energy, it's rapidly expanding banking sector, its abundance of resources and its highly educated population - it is in a much better position to ride out the challenges of the 21st Century.\n\nEngland's imperial power will continue to drain, as will its economic stature - which is what happens when you are just too damned greedy!\n\nPosted by: Cordia | November 21, 2006 10:00 PM\n\nWith regards to the post about \"Scots, English etc = British\" I was refering to the fact that all of these peoples are considered British citizens, hold British passports etc. I wasn't trying to suggest that people would refer to themselves as \"Brits\".

A year later in May 1999 Scots voted for formation of their own house (parliament).\n\nIn 1998 event, Nicola, the current deputy SNP leader was also in the same meeting and assured me and the participants that SNP is getting ready for governing and is forming its shadow ministers. Now after 8 years in opposition, those shadow ministers have proved to the Scottish public that they are ready for independence and gained the confidence of more Scots. It has been a matter of time and hard work.\n\nWith Labour, losing its support because of its Iraq war policy, SNP is in a very good position to cash on people's dissatisfaction. Another factor is the unpopulaity of the Royal family in the UK after the Diana scandal and its aftermath and people are fed up with the monarchy system. I doubt that Scotland will be a monarchy after independence, but I don't think it is a good time to discuss it in the election. SNP should be careful in raising controversial issues such as penny tax again before the election.\n\nI should also mention another factor that there is a very negative sentiments among many Scots towards English from South while very friendly to foreigners. With UK declining in the world Politics and being replaced by the US politically and overshadowed by the EURO and EU, the Scottish population finally have realised that they are better off in the long term having their own separate house, kitchen and toilet.\n\nPosted by: Dr Goran Nowicki | November 21, 2006 10:06 PM\n\nTo Sam Houston, uh friend.

Why I should \"get what I deserve\" as some of the above have suggested just because I was born in England is beyond me. That seems very spiteful.

Nowadays, most historians who have actually studied the archaeological and other evidence agree that's just a myth. As it happens, I live in a part of Scotland where people are proud of their Pictish heritage, and many have \"PICT\" car stickers. Yet the majority of us Picts around here favour an independent Scotland. \"If the will of the people wish there to be a split then so be it, lets not base it on whose side your great grand pappy fought on\" - agreed. The issue should be settled democratically, through a non-party-political single-question referendum.

But racists in Scotland are more likely to support the BRITISH National Party than the SCOTTISH National Party. The SNP's policy is determinedly multi-cultural, multi-racial, and pro-immigration, and that everybody resident in Scotland on independence day will automatically be entitled to a Scottish passport. In addition to the SNP, the other, smaller, pro-independence organisations all agree with this.\n\nPosted by: Dave Coull | November 21, 2006 11:32 PM\n\nThe above thread is really revealing of that miserable , sour , arrogant , self absorbed celtic reflex racism which we English have had to endure for so long . All with that characteristically dodgy and highly selective version of history which they just love .\n\nYou'd never believe that the union was imposed on England by a Scottish monarch ( Queen Anne ) with no consultation with the English whatsoever . Scotland was consulted though - and their parliament voted for it by a large majority .\n\nYou'd never believe that most of Scotland was enthusiastically - more so than England - against the Jacobites in 1745 - so much so they produced 4 brand new regiments for the British king just weeks before Culloden .\n\nContrary to the claim that Scots supported the emerging US in the war of independence -well a few did , most supported the King though , often fanatically -against the English Americans ie the people of New England . Tom Paine was not from North Queensferry , he was from Norfolk in England .\n\nIt might be as well to bear in mind that the very word British is a celtic word . The Romans would have been unhesitating in designating the celts and particularly the people of what is now Scotland as British .Not the English though , they would have called us German .\n\nScottish inedependence means English independence as well . The British national debt is as much the obligation of Scotland as England .

The Jacobite Rebellion was NOT about independence for Scotland, it was about restoration of the Stuart monarchy to power in London. The majority of Scots were presbyterians who feared the restoration of a Catholic monarchy. And it is wrong to say that \"Scotland was consulted\" about the Union with England. Only a handfull of people could vote in 1707. The vast majority of people in Scotland had no say in the matter, but showed how they felt through both petitions and rioting. There has NEVER been a vote on whether we want Union or Independence. A single-question, non-party-political, referendum on this is long overdue.\n\nPosted by: Dave Coull | November 22, 2006 12:25 AM\n\nThe red states are turning blue. What goes around will go around again.\n\nI'm imagining a market for sovereignty, where nations bid for each other's loyalty to form mutually beneficial confederations. Maybe Scotland will merge with Norway, England could join Saxony, Wales could form a union with Brittany and Silesia. The location of the market would, of course, be in the City of London.\n\nOr maybe voters will realize that \"nationalism\" is just a tool for politicians to create another layer of bureaucracy to enhance their personal power and privileges. Most Quebecois have figured this out; however much they don't like Ottawa at times, they have even less use for the grasping demagogues of Quebec City.\n\nEngland's economic advantages are simply a function of proximity to European markets and high-density communities in the south offering economies of scale that create wealth. Separating from the UK isn't going to move Scotland physically closer to the Chunnel and Edinburgh isn't going to suddenly become a new London.

Currently Scotland has got its own parliament (http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/home.htm) and its own legal system, so has the instruments to look after its own affairs. Since getting its own parliament in 1999, the people of Scotland have matured and gained faith in there own beliefs, despite the ongoing pro-unionist retoric that states that they cant look after themselves. The devolved government has been successful, but there is a desire to take it to the next step.

For a relatively short time they would presumably still have a political and legal connection with England. In the longer term probably the best thing would be if they could unite with the rest of Ireland, but on a FEDERAL basis, rather than with all power being concentrated in Dublin, and with strong gaurantees for the rights of protestants, and with official recognition of their distinctiveness being given by the Irish, Scottish, and English governments. But that would probably take quite a long time to work out, and would involve these three governments and all of the political parties in Northern Ireland in protracted negotiations. Scotland's claim for independence can not and will not wait for a settlement of the problems of Northern Ireland. \"Would The Orangemen want to join the new Scottish nation\" - some of them might want to join the newly independent Scotland, but, unless they actually emigrate to Scotland, they won't have that option. ALL of the pro-independence Scottish organisations have made it very clear that the Scotland they want independence for is the land where Scottish law applies at present, within it's present borders. There is no desire on the part of any political organisation in Scotland to acquire Northern Ireland or any other territory outside of Scotland's present borders.\n\nPosted by: Dave Coull | November 22, 2006 09:43 AM\n\nI wish we here in Flanders would be as close to independence as the Scots.

Whole cultures have been nearly or completely whiped out by the cultural imperialists dominating Spain, the Russian empire, the United Kingdom or France. It is time that the small nations such as Scotland, Flanders, Catalonia, the Basque country and others get their rightfull place in Europe.

Would it still exist under the same name but be played at courses in Scotland and England? I assume the Ryder Cup would still remain relatively unchanged. Posted by: Golfer | November 22, 2006 01:36 AM British Open will remain after independence and will continue to be played at the courses in both Scotland and England, as they have always done since the start of the competition (in 1860 at the course in Prestwick, Scotland). The name 'British' defines the area not a country, in the same way Scandinavia defines the area, which covers Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Likewise the Ryder Cup will remain unchanged, as it doesn't affect the fact that both Scotland and England are part of Europe. Scots in Scotland invented the game of Golf, in its present form, long before the act of Union. King James II of Scotland played golf, but the game was so popular that he had an Act of Scottish Parliament to ban it on Sundays so as to preserve the skills of archery. He declared that \"fute-ball (soccer) and Golfe be utterly cryit doune, and nocht useit!\" 'Fute-ball' had been banned by his father, King James I, in 1424. The English were a constant threat and the Scots were inferior to the English in matters of the bow and arrow. Residents of Aberdeen, St. Andrews and Leith on the east coast were the main culprits - they played and played. That was the first documented reference to today's game - the edicts of Parliament in 1457. In many parts of Scotland's east coast, parishioners were constantly being punished for playing golf \"at the time of the preaching of the Sermon.\" Two more attempts were made to restrict the playing of 'gowf,' James III banning it again in 1470 and 1493 - although the people largely ignored it. And the Scots finally had to pay the consequences. At the Battle of Flodden Field in 1513, the Scots were assaulted by English bowmen and were no match for them. England routed the Scots, who had spent so much time playing golf! King James IV (King James I of England), the grandson of the king who originally tried to ban the sport, also tried to prevent the playing of golf. But he, too, found it hopeless and gave up, eventually beginning to play the game himself. The Treaty of Glasgow lifted the ban in 1502. So as you can see the game of Golf is firmly embedded in Scotland\n\nPosted by: Edward | November 22, 2006 11:12 AM\n\nPatrick Harris Portsmouth I think your more anti-EU, than anything else, Devolution was not the result of an EU edict, you are obviously ignorant of the truth or just not aware of the facts. Devolution goes back, long before the EU was ever thought of! . In 1853 the National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights was established. This body was close to the Tories and was motivated by a desire to secure more focus on Scottish problems in response to what they felt was undue attention being focused on Ireland by the then Liberal government. In 1871, William Gladstone stated at a meeting held in Aberdeen that if Ireland was to be granted home rule, then the same should apply to Scotland. A Scottish home rule bill was presented to the Westminster Parliament in 1913, the legislative process to pass it was interrupted by the First World War. In 1978 the Labour government passed the Scotland Act which legislated for the establishment of a Scottish Assembly, provided the Scots voted for such in a plebiscite. However, the Labour Party was bitterly divided on the subject of devolution. Despite officially favouring it, vast numbers of members opposed the establishment of an assembly, and this division caused the failure to reach the required 40% of the electorate voting in favour of an assembly (that itself was a quota only added to the Scotland Act by an amendment proposed by a Labour In 1989 the Scottish Constitutional Convention was formed encompassing the Labour Party, Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Green Party, local authorities, and sections of \"civic Scotland\" like Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Small Business Federation and Church of Scotland and the other major churches in Scotland. Its purpose was to devise a scheme for the formation of a devolution settlement for Scotland. The SNP decided to withdraw as they felt that independence would not be a constitutional option countenanced by the convention. The convention produced its final report in 1995. In May 1997, the Labour government of Tony Blair was elected with a promise of creating devolved institutions in Scotland. In late 1997, a referendum was held which resulted in a \"yes\" vote. The newly-created Scottish Parliament (as a result of the Scotland Act 1998) had powers to make primary legislation in certain areas of policy, in addition to some limited tax varying powers (which to date have not been exercised). Devolution for Scotland was justified on the basis that it would aid in bringing government closer to the people in the nation. It was argued that the population of Scotland felt detached from the Westminster government (largely because of the policies of the Conservative governments led by Margaret Thatcher and John Major\n\nPosted by: Jack | November 22, 2006 11:29 AM\n\nCome on all you American/Scots & Canadian/Scots, help us win independence for Scotland in May 2007 by visiting www.snp.org\n\nPosted by: Willie Taylor | November 22, 2006 11:47 AM\n\nJack, we will have to agree to differ on the subject of the EU, as for Scotland, I really couldn't care less, you have got what you want (partially at least) and I sincerely hope you are successful in your quest for independence.

Posted by: cailet | November 22, 2006 04:22 AM In the United States, you are fortunate in that each state has its own form of government with tax raising powers and can decide independently on matters that are either ignored or overlooked by central government. The only areas that the indivudual states don't control is Defence and Foreign policy. This is actually very similar to what we have with the devolved government of Scotland. However the difference is that Scotland is a country in its own right, it was an Independent Kingdom before the act of Union and there are many (51% at the last opinion poll) who would like to see Scotland and independent Kingdom again. Many pro-unionists, north and south of the border with England have argued that Scotland could not afford to break away from England (implying it's a subsidy junkie), citing that Scotland gets a larger share of funding from the treasury in London , than the English do, especially in comparison to what Scotland puts in. The fact of the matter (which has been covered up by pro-unionist politicians) is that Scotland actually puts in more than it gets, especially when the revenues from the Scottish continental shelf are included. The pro-unionists answer to that is that Oil & Gas revenues from Scotlands Continental Shelf fields are small on a re head of population basis for the UK. It doesn't take a genius to see that considering the population as a whole for the UK is in the region of 60 million, that may be true, but with an Independent Scotland, which has a population of 5 million, the revenues, generated, although small in comparison to say those in the middle east, would be more than enough to support Scotland's population (which is estimated at around GBP 2500 per head of population in Scotland)\n\nPosted by: Edward | November 22, 2006 11:48 AM\n\nto Patrick Harris Portsmouth Im all for a Parliament for England, in an Independant Kingdom of England, voted for by the population of England.

Canada continues to evolve peacefully towards the future, whatever it may hold. Virtually every one of these posts feels that the tragedies and injustices of the past (from all sides) will be super-imposed on the future.

The threat of Quebec separation in Canada is far more serious a threat than Scotland and Ireland's situation, yet it hasn't come about despite two referendum attempts. Why? Because the man and woman on the street inherently understand that there's nothing to be gained from embracing uncertainty, especially economic uncertainty. And as for those americans still obsessing over King George, get over it already...what a tired old horse that's become! Better yet, re-visit the causes of the famous 'Boston Tea Party' and you might find that it wasn't about 'taxation without representation', so much as the crown attempting to intercept and tax smuggled contraband goods that represented the special economic interests of several soon-to-be 'founders'...and the cowards had the nerve to disguise themselves as native americans, a people who could teach all of us quite a bit about 'colonial oppression' if we'd take the time to listen.\n\nPosted by: Stormcrow | November 22, 2006 12:21 PM\n\n\" Very Strange notion to me- this splitting apart.

Once Scotland becomes an independent nation the revenues will remain in Scotland. Its actually a joke to say that the trade routes opened after the act of union, a point that's glazed over is the fact that the English Navy at the behest of the English parliament went out of its way to hinder and in some incidences attack Scottish vessels before the union, as a result of the union, Scotland's trade routes that were flourishing, were curtailed as Scotland's merchants had to comply and accept those that were acceptable to the English. You should read up on what actually happened before, during and after the act of union. A good example would be the Darien project in which Scotland endeavoured to establish a colony in central America, with recommendations by English financiers on what's best. It's a fact that they were ill prepared and the area that was advised for them to go to was not suitable, when it failed and when the Scottish ships and colony were attacked, a request was sent to the English Navy to assist (remember this is at a time when both countries were under a single crown), they English Navy refused, after ordered by London not to help in any way!. If there had not been the oil and gas finds in Scotland's Continental Shelf, I would Have not been surprised, if Scotland had been granted independence a lot earlier, as there was nothing for England to get out of the union, by remaining with Scotland other than the Oil and gas. I agree both nations should be moving away from fossil fuels, it is fortunate that Scotland also has a Hydro Electric scheme, which is currently being increased, together with developing more in the way of wind and wave power\n\nPosted by: | November 22, 2006 04:26 PM\n\n\"That by the way is blatantly racist!, which would also suggest that your most probably English.\"\n\nThat comment in itself is racist, to imply that because somebody makes a racist comment they are automatically English seems hypocritical.\n\n\"Scotland is probably the most integrated society in western Europe, something that sticks in the throat of some English people\"\n\nOnly I would have thought the throats of Englishmen who share the same racist sentiment as any person of a racist disposition in Europe, be the Scottish, French, German etc. I've watched European politics closely and it appears countries like France, Austria and the Netherlands have a bigger problem with the likes of their right wing parties then the English, Scottish or Welsh have with the BNP, white nationalists etc.\n\n\"Only a Unionist or Englishman\"\n\nSurely you mean only a Unionist as the above posts show there are plenty of non-Unionist Englishmen.\n\nYou seem to have to have a little grudge yourself against the English, do you not think you would be better working with the English nationalists in achieving your goal rather then implying that the English are racist and Unionist by default?\n\nPosted by: Denis MA | November 22, 2006 04:34 PM\n\nI stand corrected Denis MA, it was wrong to imply that the racists comments came from either someone who is English or a Unionist, I hadnt intended to suggest that.

Hang together, or hang separately.\n\nPosted by: jimbobuddy | November 22, 2006 05:31 PM\n\nDenis MA : Well I agree, in modern terms, ideally 2 nations can work together as equal partners. The problem though with the United Kingdom was that it was founded at the start of the 18th Century, with a treaty (the act of union 1707) that cobbled together 2 political institutes, which was derived through corruption and subterfuge, religion also played its part. Allthough we should be forward thinking, it does help to understand the backdrop as to why things happened. Independence and home rule has been in discussion since the 19th century, so its not something thats just happened overnight. If it had been a partnership of equal parts, then there would not have been wrong doings such as the Glencoe masacre and th highland clearances which happened after the union. If it had been equal, there would have been equal investment, so we would not have a situation where people migrate south to London 'as thats where the jobs are'. Its only been within the last 5 to 10 years with the devolved parliament in Scotland that there has been a slow redress of the situation, nut like with anything too little too late. Scots now have the desire to continue with devolution, but to take it to the next step, which involves more fiscal powers, to have a bigger say in the world in having its own defence and foreign policy, that can only come about by tearing up the act of union. Scotland can still work with England, but with separate political institutions\n\nPosted by: Edward | November 22, 2006 05:33 PM\n\nto jimbobuddy I doubt it, Not really sure where you get this idea that Scotland would be marginalised (this is a regular arguement put out by unionists)Scotland will have the same standing as England will Ive seen this arguement so many times, but bo one has actually explained why\n\nPosted by: Jack | November 22, 2006 05:37 PM\n\nEdward> With regards to London I think that's the same in most countries. People migrate towards New York, Boston, LA etc. as thats where the money is. Head out into the mid-west and it's a lot poorer then say California or the East coast. I'm sure that's the same with most countries, not that it's necessarly right, but very much the case. I'm also sure there are remoter parts of England that suffer the same problem as Scotland ? There must have also been wrongs against the Englsh from the period you speak off? You only have to look at the industrial revolution to see how the ruling classes trated the poor, what with the work houses and all. All I'm saying is that the people that makes the decisions in history tend to be a small select group and blaming a whole country of people, whether you be English or Scottish for the other ills seems to let the real perputraitors of the hook. I hope England and Scotland do work together what ever routes they take, or we will simply see you both taking a step backwards which can't be good for the people living there?\n\nPosted by: Denis MA | November 22, 2006 05:46 PM\n\nDenis MA asks \"do you not think you would be better working with the English nationalists in achieving your goal\" - No, I don't. In my experience, English Nationalists really do tend to be racists. It is well know in every country where football (\"soccer\") is played that flag-waving supporters of the England football team have an unfortunate reputation internationally. Even if English Nationalists are not racist in other respects, their attitude towards us Scots is completely unacceptable. It's like asking supporters of Black Pride in the USA to co-operate with the Ku Klux Klan. \"rather then implying that the English are racist and Unionist by default\" - There are many millions of English people who are certainly NOT racists. Unfortunately, they are usually NOT the ones who describe themselves as \"English Nationalists\". The people in England who are the natural allies of Scots who want independence are the ones who say \"okay, we recognise that you Scots have genuine grievances with the UK. We kinda wish you didn't want to leave the UK, but we recognise that you do have a right to do so\".\n\nPosted by: Dave Coull | November 22, 2006 07:37 PM\n\nchiron82 wrote \"51% of scots want to secede?\" - No. That opinion poll suggested 51 percent OF EVERYBODY ENTITLED TO VOTE would support independence. The same opinion poll suggested that 39 percent would vote against. Now, if you add 51 and 39, you get 90. Not 100. Not a percentage. The other 10 percent are \"don't knows\". Exeprience shows that the don't knows will either (a) not vote, or (b) divide in the same 51/39 proportions. Therefore the percentage likely to vote for independence is 55, not 51. This is in line with other opinion polls. But I think it a safe bet that the real outcome of a referendum will in fact be a FAR higher percentage for independence. The experiences of Quebec and Puerto Rico are totally irrelevant. This is not some province we are talking about. This is a kingdom which was independent for a thousand years. As for \"the almighty federal subsidy\", the UK is not a federation, and Scotland isn't subsidized.\n\nPosted by: Dave Coull | November 22, 2006 07:56 PM\n\nSomebody or other said about us Scots who want independence \"Lets be blunt. We are white christens\" - as a matter of fact, a significant percentage of the Scots who want independence are neither white nor Christian. \"This movement is based on race, greed, and good old Scottish cheepnes\" - You really don't know the first thing about Scotland, do you? \"What happens when the oil and gas is no more?\" - Scotland is well able to support itself without either oil or gas. We have plenty of several other valuable commodities. Renewable energy sources, for instance.\n\nPosted by: Dave Coull | November 22, 2006 08:03 PM\n\nDave> From what I could gather from following the world cup England seems to have removed the element that caused trouble except for a few small incerdents ?

The flag that the thug element of English supporters wave is definitely an English one. Yes of course there are many millions of good people in England who are certainly not racists, including some friends and relations of mine, and yes of course they will be our good neighbours when we are independent. But I'm a member of Independence First, the single-issue, non-party-political, campaign for a referendum on independence for Scotland ( www.independence1st.com ) and I see absolutely no possibility of our campaign working together with the sort of English Nationalist who complains that \"the Jocks get things too much their own way as it is\".\n\nPosted by: Dave Coull | November 22, 2006 09:26 PM\n\nHow fitting to end with football silliness.

It was forced and created by Englishmen, Mostly greedy lords with money on minds and blood on hands. This native indegenous blood of the gaelic scot, welsh or irish became that of the indian or african. As the celts became more english and aceptable they moved up the british food chain, \"Hunted becomes the hunter\" The imperial experiment grew, the UK/british idea grew morphing into imperialism. UK Higher classes preached how civil they where and believed it. It eventually has to practice what it preached. International pressure and technological advancement ie TV/press & Freedom of speach has lead to a sleeping giant of an oppressed native group of peoples re-surfacing. An example would be welsh language rights growth. I am irish, free of forieng monarchs and governments yet desperate to see a modern scotland, Wales, england and ireland emerge from these historical chains which linger on even today. Look and Northern Ireland, pure tribalism. It is referd to by my elders as remnants of empire. Its solution is directly linked to the UKs break up. It would simply make its argument redundant. So much to say so little time. The world needs a free scotland. It would mature the EU, Westminster & Wasington. The current international power houses are mainly western this is because of technology but there international policy is not driven by humanity but money. The scottish question has economic elements (ironically oil) but is primarily idealistic. Imperial logic needs to be sent into the history books. International decisions need social logic not economic. This can happen only if a big consequence results from economic policy making. Scotland leaving (ending) the UK will send an international political message. Scots are currently not equal within the UK. They will leave eventually.

She picked up a handset, grasping one buzzer in each hand, closed her eyes, and the session began.\n\nThe room was quiet. Through the headphones, Henn heard an alternating tone — first in the right ear, then the left, back and forth. The handset buzzed in synchrony, right-left-right-left, part of a trauma treatment that also involves recalling painful memories. She turned her thoughts to the day her brother, Nate, died.\n\nNate Henn had been visiting relatives and working with Invisible Children, a nonprofit in Kampala, Uganda. On July 11, 2010, he was at a sports complex with friends, enjoying the broadcast of a World Cup soccer match, when terrorists struck. Nate was only 25 when shrapnel from a bomb ended his life.\n\nThe years hadn’t diminished Brynne Henn’s pain.\n\n“ ‘Your brother’s dead, and you need to come home to take care of your mom,’ ” she remembered her father saying. With those simple words, her brother was gone — and she felt compelled to take control in the ensuing chaos. Henn, who had been visiting her boyfriend in Chapel Hill, immediately returned home to Raleigh, N.C.\n\n“I didn’t stop for the first week after Nate died,” she said.\n\nThe ordeal didn’t end with the news of Nate’s death. Her other brother, Kyle, rushed home from Delaware to be with the family. But the private plane carrying him crashed the next day in nearby Chapel Hill. The pilot was killed and the co-pilot was seriously injured, but Kyle survived.\n\n“And then the media storm went crazy,” Henn said. The family already had received inquiries from journalists about Nate’s death; Kyle’s brush with death only intensified the interest of media outlets from Philadelphia to Raleigh.\n\n“It made it so much worse,” Henn said. At age 20, she began functioning as the family spokeswoman. “I felt like I had to protect my family from all of it,” she said. She occupied herself with press inquiries and funeral arrangements. But after the whirlwind passed, unaddressed grief remained with her.\n\nWhen a person experiences trauma, the associated memories can remain as vivid and urgent as on the day the event happened. The brain perceives the trauma as happening in the present and reacts accordingly, even in safe situations.\n\nWhen Henn’s traumatic memories of her brother’s violent death were triggered, they “popped” and glowed in her mind as if they were being shown on a projector screen.\n\n“All these memories around me started playing like a video loop,” Henn said. Her body remembered the sensations vividly: the heat and discomfort of the summer day, the pain of her high heels as she delivered the eulogy at the funeral.\n\nHenn did cognitive behavioral therapy — a form of conventional talk therapy — for five years.\n\n“It helped me realize feelings were normal,” she explained, and that she was not weak for reeling from the tragedy. “But I never felt like I was getting over it.” Random memories could send her spiraling into panic and fear. Talk therapy helped her manage those attacks, but it didn’t address the root cause.\n\nHenn was initially diagnosed with a condition known as complicated grief; she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder only last year. She was surprised. She had thought of PTSD as an affliction of soldiers and others directly involved in horrendous events — not of people like her, suffering from the ripple effects of a bombing in Uganda.\n\nIt was Kyle Henn, recovering from his own PTSD after surviving the plane crash, who recommended eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy, or EMDR.\n\nPsychologist Francine Shapiro developed EMDR in 1987. Three years later, she founded the EMDR Institute, which has trained more than 100,000 practitioners.\n\nSome therapists use sounds from headphones during a session. Others use eye movement, moving a finger or object back and forth as the patient follows, eyes moving left to right and back again. Others employ a bar on which small bulbs light up from one side to another.\n\nPatients follow the light or object with their eyes or listen to the alternating tone while thinking about a specific traumatic memory or series of memories. They describe the memories to the therapist, who gives guidance as needed.\n\nThe idea is that reliving the memories helps remove the sting and that the urgency of the memories can be reduced as the brain begins to move them from short-term to long-term memory. The sound or the eye movement is supposed to activate both sides of the brain in an imitation of REM sleep, when the brain usually converts short-term memories into long-term recollections.\n\nStudies have found benefits to EMDR. But there is debate about whether the eye movement makes a difference, said Stephen Holland, founder of the Capital Institute for Cognitive Therapy and co-author of the textbook “Treatment Plans and Interventions for Depression and Anxiety Disorders.” “The question is whether stimulation adds to it.” He does not use it in his practice because he considers it no more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nBrynne Henn, who lives in the District, began seeing a licensed clinical psychologist who practices EMDR last September. In Gail Kalin’s office, nestled in a tree-shaded apartment building in Northwest Washington, Henn confronted the trauma that still haunted her.\n\nThe techniques associated with EMDR may merely have a placebo effect, some psychologists say. In early sessions, Henn focused on the headphones and handset; they helped distract her from the terror of reliving the traumatic events surrounding her brother’s death, she said. This distraction had a positive effect on her, she said, allowing her to dive deeply into the therapy without freezing in the face of fear.\n\nSome insurance plans cover EMDR. Henn’s does not; she pays for the sessions out of pocket.\n\nHenn, who is a communications associate at a Washington research institution, was initially very skeptical of EMDR.\n\n“It is so weird,” she said. “When I first got there and she hands me these two paddles that vibrate in my hands, and then [I] put on these giant headphones — I was, like: What is this, a hearing test? What are we doing?”\n\nBut Henn was encouraged by the progress she made. “I started getting really interested in it,” she said. “Why is my brain coming up with this? What in the world are you doing to me, that this is what I came up with?” Henn was surprised by the vivid memories — some of which she hadn’t known existed — that resurfaced after so much time had passed.\n\nIt didn’t matter to her whether research supported EMDR; what mattered was whether it worked for her. Each time a particularly painful memory resurfaced, Henn said, “you have to go through it again until it has no meaning.” By confronting the trauma head-on, she added, it became less powerful.\n\n“It’s integrating what’s stuck in time,” explained Kalin, the psychologist. Memories formed under the adrenaline of trauma are never put to rest, she said. “EMDR processing is untangling the knot.”\n\nOnce the memories are processed, therapists say, they are less vivid — less like the film reel Henn would see in her mind. Henn was able to recall processed memories without feeling panic.\n\nEMDR’s central appeal lies in the possibility of closure — an end to PTSD, and to therapy for it.\n\n“I’m going to come out equipped with tools to take care of myself,” Henn said. She already has put these tools to the test: Two months after she started EMDR, terrorists hit Paris, killing at least 130 people.\n\nSoon after that attack, she heard reports that a video, possibly from the Islamic State, contained a threat to hit Washington next, and she had a “full-fledged panic attack,” she said.\n\n“I was not sure where I was; I was sweating profusely but also really cold,” she said. She stepped onto the 11th-floor terrace at work and looked down.\n\n“The thought came into my head: ‘I just need to walk off, and that will wake me up,’ ” Henn remembered. “And I had enough awareness that I sat myself down and was trying to think of calming breaths and going back and forth” — actions reminiscent of EMDR processing.\n\n“It took a while, and it was a little terrifying that I had that thought,” she said. “But the process of being able to calm myself down was much better than anything I had been equipped with before.”\n\nIn a few weeks, Henn mentioned to Kalin, she would be marrying her college sweetheart. Beneath the excitement, she felt a twinge of panic: How would she react to her brother’s absence from the wedding? She asked a close friend to write a speech from Nate’s point of view, as if he were speaking at the celebration. But Henn admitted she was worried that the speech would trigger an extreme emotional reaction, a fear shared by many who suffer from PTSD. They never know when the trauma will reignite; it can spread from the smallest spark, even on the happiest day.\n\n“Does EMDR deal with the future?” she asked Kalin. Kalin nodded, and they began processing memories again.\n\nAmong the painful recollections, Henn encountered a happy memory — friends who arrived at the funeral to support the family — and a smile broke through the tears.\n\n“It felt like a gift from Nate,” she said.\n\nEMDR, Henn said, allowed her to have a do-over — to be able to grieve properly and then to move beyond grief. She was finally able to remember the good times with her brother without being overwhelmed by pain.\n\n“I’m still sad, but I’m not hurt by it anymore,” she said. “It’s not opening up any fresh wounds.”\n\nAs Henn walked outside into a brisk April evening after her session, there was a new easiness to her, as though something had finally been freed.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nBrynne Henn, 26, leaned back onto a pristine white couch and settled white-and-red headphones over her ears.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00008-of-00064--718", "original_text": "Chrysler is bankrupt and General Motors may be next. Both those companies and Ford Motor –which is neither bankrupt nor on the dole from the federal government–are shutting plants. In contrast, the non-U.S. automakers are still building U.S. factories. Volkswagen is erecting an assembly plant in Tennessee, Kia Motors has a plant going up in Georgia, and Toyota Motor is putting one up in Mississippi, although it has delayed opening there because of the slump in auto sales.\n\nForeign auto manufacturers and suppliers already have a massive presence in the U.S. Many of these new transplant factories are in the Sun Belt: South Carolina (BMW), Mississippi ( Nissan ), Tennessee (Nissan), Alabama (Mercedes, Honda and Hyundai), Texas ( Toyota ), and Kentucky (Toyota). The foreigners do have a few plants in the North, too: Honda in Ohio and Indiana, and Toyota and Subaru-Toyota in Indiana.\n\nMost of the foreign-owned plants are non-union, with a few exceptions. Mitsubishi has a unionized plant in Illinois, though the future of that factory is uncertain. Mazda builds cars in a Ford-run plant in Michigan, and there is a unionized Toyota-GM joint venture in Fremont, Calif. Italy’s Fiat plans to build its vehicles in one or more Chrysler facilities (all of Chrysler’s plants are unionized).\n\nThis transplant industry is replacing Detroit’s manufacturing. Through mid May, all North American assembly plants (including Canada and Mexico) have built 2.77 million cars and light trucks, half the production level of the year-earlier period. Of these, Detroit’s Big Three have built only 1.5 million of these vehicles, just 268,000 more than the transplants.\n\nIt may only be weeks or a few months before the transplants will be building more vehicles here than our old Big Three. The foreign producers have reduced production in this downturn, but they have not permanently closed plants. Except for the Mitsubishi factory in Illinois, the others all seem safe.\n\nWhen times are good, these American transplants are quite profitable–in fact, they are the greatest earning centers for Toyota and Honda. But it wasn’t always this way: A while back, I recall the chief financial officer of Toyota (he later became chief executive) coming to America and telling me: “General Motors makes money manufacturing cars in the U.S. Ford makes money building cars in the U.S. I’m here to find out why we aren’t making money building cars in the U.S.”\n\nToyota solved its problems, while the Detroit automakers collapsed. One reason: the unions.\n\nThe Detroit auto plants are all unionized (United Auto Workers), and union stewards are on the company payroll at every car plant, at a cost of millions of dollars. The UAW works to keep the production pace down. One “transplant” plant manager who used to work for Detroit figures his people were working 10% faster that at a Detroit plant. If Detroit workers did 50 jobs an hour, his people did 55.\n\nDetroit pay and benefits ran about $55 an hour, vs. an average of $45 for the transplants, with Korean automakers paying less. Those “legacy” costs–health care and pension payments to retirees–add another $16 an hour to the domestics’ costs. So Detroit’s total labor runs about $70 to $75 an hour, vs. $49 for Japanese transplants.\n\nIn the current crisis, the union has been making big concessions, but it’s too late. The transplant workers are new, young and country-style. Suddenly, they had real jobs and futures–instead of pumping gas or growing old working at burger joints. The Big Three workers are older, tired and often from urban environments. Doing less was always the goal, and they bragged about it, too, which is why auto workers may not be particularly popular, even in their own towns. Foreign manufacturers, with American plant managers, won over their factory workers with a new culture: uniforms for everyone, democracy in the parking lot and no executive dining rooms.\n\nThe foreign culture was about more than parking spaces. Its real focus was on eliminating class warfare from the factory floor. The Japanese and the Germans, too, put particular emphasis on teamwork and quality. Detroit talked a lot about quality but did not always deliver on its promises. Quality means everything from poor fit and finish, gaps between exterior and interior parts, hard plastic that looks cheap and transmissions that break down at 50,000 miles. My favorite Detroit expression was “perceived quality.” That meant if you paid $30,000 for a car and found a scratch in the door, it wasn’t a quality issue. Why? The car still ran, so it was “perceived quality.”\n\nListen to Robert Dewar, who worked at Ford’s Sharonville, Ohio, transmission plant in the late 1970s: “Final quality fluctuated with the amount of power granted to the Quality Control Department. When sales were strong and growing, QC was treated like an annoyance that was getting in the way of making the numbers. If a QC supervisor tried to be a hero, and made a stand, production simply went to engineering and got an ‘engineering deviation,’ which allowed the use of defective parts in the interests of production. So much for control of quality.”\n\nAs quality complaints piled up, Detroit tried to imitate the foreigners, and we heard a lot about quality programs, quality circles and quality gurus. Why didn’t they succeed? Robert Dewer’s book, A Savage Factory, describes the factory floor like a constant war between rival street gangs, management vs. the union and workers. His book is well worth a read.\n\nToyota took over a badly managed GM plant in California; it was a joint venture, but the Japanese ran the plant. GM sent young executives to work there and learn Toyota’s manufacturing and quality techniques. They learned, but when they came back to GM, the GM bureaucracy would not change its ways.\n\nUnder former Chief Executive Roger Smith, GM set up the new Saturn factory with a new type of work-together atmosphere with the UAW: no time clocks, annual pay and teams. The company and the union both hated the new ideas, and when Roger was gone and the UAW got a new president, they worked at–and eventually succeeded in–destroying the Saturn brand.\n\nEven the good car people–like Robert Lutz, who saved Chrysler and led the product revival at GM before its fall–did not believe there was a quality gap between Detroit’s cars and the transplants. But mechanics working on cars knew better, when they kept finding failures in sub-assemblies such as the heating and air conditioning systems, which are hard to get at and expensive to repair.\n\nDetroit’s problems go beyond the factory floor; Washington also deserves blame for the catastrophe. Our politicians refused to defend the auto industry, allowing the Japanese to develop their car business here with imports paid for with undervalued currency. Our government never insisted on realistic currency exchange, or that foreign countries, including Japan and Korea, allow our companies to manufacture on their soil and sell in their markets.\n\nWhy wasn’t our government more demanding? The Pentagon and the State Department were more interested in seeing Japan and South Korea with strong capitalistic economies and as bastions against communism. They never really cared about Midwestern metal-benders.\n\nAsian nations were not overt, but instead used subtle means to discourage U.S. companies from making strong inroads into their markets. Ford, for example, once announced it would build an assembly plant in Yokohama, Japan. Then the authorities condemned the site for the construction of a sewage plant. At one time, the South Korean equivalent of the IRS investigated anyone who bought a foreign car. The exception: If a foreign company was going down, foreign governments allowed the Americans to come in and save it, as the Koreans allowed GM to take over and rescue Daewoo.\n\nThen there are government rules and regulations: the Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and others. This is not to say that all those rules on worker safety, on pollution and everything else are not good, but they do push up costs. We know the same rules do not exist in China, Mexico and South Korea.\n\nState governments have also done their share to help cripple the home team. They heavily subsidized the building of new plants by foreign car makers. Such aid included paying for roads, water and sewage, worker training and tax relief. A $500 million subsidy per plant was not unusual. Foreigners have been building cars in new, modern factories, built for flexible production, with tax abatements, while Detroit companies were stuck in less efficient plants.\n\nAt one time, General Motors considered a Southern strategy–building new plants in areas where workers were unlikely to vote in a union. The United Auto Workers made it clear it would fight, legally or illegally–meaning strikes, slowdowns and chaos in GM’s more northern plants. GM gave up on the idea.\n\nWhat about Detroit’s managers? Exports from America were never important to them: GM and Ford believed in building the cars that people wanted, but building them in their respective markets. Thus, they had operations in Europe that built cars the Europeans liked, and the same in South America and China. That was fine, but American executives also had a prejudice against small cars and small engines. In the Midwest, bigger is better.\n\nThe truth is that a smaller car costs nearly as much to build as a bigger car, and our execs could not see how they could sell a smaller car unless its sticker price was considerably below that of a bigger car. This enormous mistake opened the market here to the foreign automakers, which developed a growing market for smaller cars, and then moved up-market to bigger, more expensive and higher-margined vehicles.\n\nIt has not helped that the modern leaders of Detroit were preoccupied with Wall Street, the stock price, quarterly projections and stockholder values. In contrast, the Japanese focused on product quality and engineering, and continuously improving their factory systems.\n\nOne more thing: Car plants become profitable when running full and with overtime. To do that, the car companies must build vehicles the customers want. Detroit’s managers not only didn’t care about the factories, they didn’t care about the products or understand American car buyers.\n\nTimes have changed. The worker-management battles in Detroit’s factories may have ended. The union and companies may embrace each other, and the quality may be as good as the foreign competition. Unfortunately, Detroit may have already damaged its reputation beyond repair.\n\nYes, Washington’s lack of interest and support, state subsidies of foreign manufacturing, high union wages and inflexible work rules all hurt domestic car companies. But the failure of American managers to build better cars is what really has led to the crisis in Detroit.\n\nRead on for more about jobs, manufacturing and the economy in our special report, “Made In America.”\n\nComments are turned off for this post.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nChrysler is bankrupt and General Motors may be next.

The speaker of the Senate, Pietro Grasso, a longtime anti-mafia magistrate, is also a possibility.\n\nAlthough most opposition parties are pushing for quick elections, opponents of Mr. Renzi within his Democratic Party are more inclined to take their time. — GAIA PIANIGIANI\n\nBeppe Grillo, the leader of the Five Star Movement who campaigned against the proposed constitutional changes and against Mr. Renzi, declared on Monday that “times have changed.”\n\nHow much so may depend on Mr. Grillo’s ability to parlay his latest success into a full sweep of the political establishment he has thumbed his nose at for years.\n\nMr. Grillo, a former comedian, said that Italians should waste no time pressing for a new electoral law and for the dismantling of the old order.\n\n“You should vote as soon as possible,” he said in a blog post on Monday to rally his supporters against the usual jockeying by parties for power in a caretaker government. “The parties will do anything to drag their feet,” he said.\n\nThe Five Star Movement won a quarter of the vote in 2013 national elections. At that time, Mr. Grillo said cooperating with traditional parties in any sort of alliance would be akin to capitulation.\n\n“The existing political class must be expelled immediately,” he said in an interview at that time with The New York Times. — JEFFREY MARCUS\n\nA breakdown of returns shows that opposition to the constitutional changes was widespread, though more pronounced in the south.\n\nOnly three regions backed the changes: the historically leftist areas of Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna in central Italy, and Trentino-Alto Adige in the far north.\n\nIn the economically struggling Sicily and Sardinia, which voted against the changes, the divide between the camps was as large as 44 percentage points. The pattern was similar in areas with high unemployment and social problems.\n\n“The country isn’t growing, and voters blamed their personal condition on the government,” said Stefano Folli, a commentator for La Repubblica.\n\nThe results also reflected a generational divide. According to a survey reported by the news channel Sky TG24, young voters rejected the proposed changes, while more than half of those over 55 supported them. — GAIA PIANIGIANI\n\nIn parsing the results, Italian pundits did not always agree, except on one point: the severe consequences for Mr. Renzi.\n\n“Does Renzi represent the country from a political, cultural point of view? Yesterday’s vote is a clear rejection of Renzi’s economic policies and of how he envisioned the country,” the political commentator Mario Sechi said. Mr. Renzi “doesn’t represent the zeitgeist of the nation, which did not follow him,” he added.\n\nFor Mr. Sechi, the Five Star Movement is the clear victor, even if the “no” campaign brought together divergent political forces.\n\nSergio Fabbrini, director of the Luiss School of Government in Rome, said the outcome was less clear. Rejection of the constitutional changes was actually a reaction to Mr. Renzi’s “reformist program that in some way threatened a big part of the social political equilibrium,” he said.\n\nThe nearly 60 percent of the population that voted against him is “highly divided, with nothing in common, and no leader,” Mr. Fabbrini said. What joins them is a conservative, anti-European outlook. “Within that, you have the most extreme left and right.”\n\nThe person to watch in the short term is Mr. Mattarella, the president. “This is the first real test of the president of the Republic, who has kept mostly in the background,” said Antonio Polito, deputy director of the Milan-based daily Corriere della Sera. — ELISABETTA POVOLEDO\n\nThe euro recovered from early losses, and European stocks edged up. It was a muted reaction, in part because a vote against the constitutional changes was expected, giving investors time to adjust their portfolios. Also, political instability in Rome is not exactly unusual.\n\nBut analysts said Italy was not in the clear, and there is potential for market turmoil in the case of government paralysis and of delays to plans to fix Italy’s ailing banks.\n\nThe euro first fell as much as 1.5 percent against the dollar in Asian trading after the vote, but recovered by the morning in Europe, and it even gained ground compared with last week. Major European stock markets were all slightly higher. — JACK EWING\n\nHow leaders of European populist movements have reacted to the election of Donald J. Trump.\n\nThe vote results and Mr. Renzi’s decision to step down drew a jubilant response from other populist leaders in Europe.\n\n“Italians have disavowed the E.U. and Renzi,” Marine Le Pen, the head of the National Front in France, wrote on Twitter. “We need to listen to this thirst for nations’ freedom and for protection!”\n\nLes Italiens ont désavoué l'UE et Renzi. Il faut écouter cette soif de liberté des nations et de protection !MLP #referendumcostituzionale\n\nWith polls predicting that Ms. Le Pen will reach the 2017 presidential election runoff, she has sought to build an anti-establishment platform calling for a “Frexit” and a “People’s Spring.” The vote in Britain to withdraw from the European Union, a process known as Brexit, and Donald J. Trump’s recent victory in the United States have put wind in her sails.\n\nThe far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who recently refused to attend his hate-speech trial, used Twitter to congratulate “Italia + Matteo Salvini,” a reference to the leader of the anti-immigrant Northern League. — BENOÎT MORENNE\n\nWriting in Italy’s leading economic newspaper, Il Sole 24 Ore, the columnist Guido Gentili said that after the referendum, Italy needed to show through actions and legislation that it “is not impermeable to reform.”\n\nThe image of Italy as a nation that “bobs more or less happily in stagnant water between the third largest public debt in the world and a banking system in a deep coma” must be “vigorously contested,” he wrote.\n\n“Just as a ‘Yes’ victory wouldn’t have been a passport to paradise, the ‘No’ vote is not a condemnation to hell. In any case, hard and serious work is needed to face a massive challenge, of finding real growth and modernizing a system that’s been weakened by a violent crisis and by innumerable problems that have been dragging on for decades.”\n\nVincenzo Boccia, the president of Italy’s main business lobby, Confindustria, said the referendum results highlighted the need to tackle pressing economic issues like “debt, deficit and still-insufficient growth.”\n\n“Growth is the only way to eliminate inequalities and poverty,” he said in a statement issued Monday morning. Italian companies have been making “crucial efforts” to compete in international markets, he added, and need the government to back them up. — ELISABETTA POVOLEDO\n\nThe populist victory in Italy was hailed by many like-minded leaders across Eastern Europe, where similar sentiments are on the rise, but their reaction was tempered by widespread concern that the results would accelerate the fraying of the European Union, upon which the region has come to depend.\n\nRight-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.\n\nPoland, the largest economy in the region, seemed torn between praising a victory by populists who share its governing party views and worrying about vulnerability to Russia.\n\n“This would be a major blow not just for the E.U. but for the eurozone,” Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said in an interview with Polish state radio. “What will the future bring?”\n\nTomas Sedlacek, chief macroeconomic strategist in Prague for the lender CSOB, tied the Italian defeat directly to Mr. Trump’s victory and predicted a dire future. “Democracy, and the future of the euro in Europe, is truly walking on the edge of a knife,” he said.\n\nIn Slovakia, where anti-euro sentiment is widespread, many residents are convinced that embracing the currency led to higher prices for everyday goods. “We can expect a referendum about leaving the eurozone,” predicted Richard Zulik, leader of Slovakia’s liberal Freedom and Solidarity party. — RICK LYMAN\n\nFinance ministers from the 19 countries that use the euro expressed relief that the economic reaction to the Italian referendum was muted. Yet the vote could still roil the European Union: It threatens to embolden opponents of the single currency, which could destabilize the Italian economy and foment turmoil in the banking sector.\n\nHelping to stoke that concern is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy’s oldest lender, which faces questions about whether it has sufficient capital.\n\nAsked whether a planned capital increase for the beleaguered bank would now be delayed, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the so-called Eurogroup of finance ministers, emphasized that Italy first needed to select a new leader.\n\nEven as Brussels scrambled to stave off negative financial consequences, ministers from fiscally hawkish countries like Germany and the Netherlands will not want to be seen by their own electorates as being overly permissive toward Italy.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nItaly woke up to uncertainty on Monday, with a headline in the daily La Repubblica declaring, “The No triumphs, Renzi quits,” echoing the sentiment in most newspapers.

Yes, even a No. 8 seed has a shot at a title -- you know, if everything falls into place perfectly.\n\nThere are plenty of teams with healthy chances at winning the 2014 NBA championship, and other teams that just need an anything-is-possible speech right now. So to set the stage for the this season's playoffs, here's doing just that with each playoff team's scenario for winning the title.\n\nHero-in-waiting: Kyle Korver is one of the great 3-point shooters of his generation, but he'll never get Robert Horry-type love until he's given an opportunity to thrive deep in the postseason. Here's his chance.\n\nHow they win it all: There's never, in the history of sports that require a ball, been a series like this -- a dominant No. 1 seed faces a No. 8 seed with a losing record ... and yet it's actually conceivable something crazy could happen. The Pacers collapsed into the top seed while the Hawks actually won six of eight to end the season with the eighth spot. Atlanta even went into Indy and blew out the Pacers just two weeks ago. Indy is just a 7-point favorite at home in Game 1.\n\nThe Hawks are outmatched at most positions, but they do have that intangible workman quality that Indiana lost when the roster was tinkered with and the team began to implode. The Hawks need to come with intensity in the first two games, and look to push Indy on its heels early. Catch the Pacers while they're still down, and the Hawks could just maybe pull off the improbable. From there, the Hawks need to face the inexperienced Wizards and catch a Nets team in the Eastern Conference Finals that's injury-riddled after beating the Heat.\n\nAt that point, they need Al Horford to come back, the Mavericks to be the Cinderella of the West, and hope Korver hits 10 3s per game. But there's still a 0.1 percent chance, right?\n\nHero-in-waiting: Al Jefferson posters are already plastered all over North Carolina just for making the playoffs, but the postseason hero will need to be Kemba Walker if the Bobcats want to pull off the impossible.\n\nHow they win it all: Idioms don't win titles, but there is truth to that tired cliche about defense winning championships. The Pacers and Bulls didn't earn home court because they play like Steve Nash's Suns. So if you've just started paying attention to the NBA because it's the playoffs, the quick lesson here is the Bobcats are an elite defensive team. That doesn't mean they can stop LeBron James, but they might be able to slow him down.\n\nCharlotte turned the ball over less than any other team in the league since the All-Star break, and controlling turnovers paired with good defense is a recipe to stay close in games. The Bobcats will need offense, but if Kemba goes 2011 Huskies, he might be the spark to pull off the upset. Once Goliath is tackled, running through the rest of the East will look easy. In the NBA Finals, a streaky offense like the Rockets or Blazers would be the perfect matchup to flex the defensive advantage and get Michael Jordan another trophy.\n\nHero-in-waiting: John Freaking Wall. The 23-year-old is finally getting a chance to take part in the NBA postseason, which means he'll be on a consistent national stage for the first time since Kentucky. He's capable of 30-plus points with double-digit assists, and he will need exactly that if the Wizards could ever snatch a title.\n\nHow they win it all: There's no question the Wizards can escape at least the first round against the Bulls. The Wizards don't play defense like Chicago, but they do get out and score, and a hot series from Wall and Bradley Beal could be just enough. Washington will certainly have to survive by burying many, many 3s. Once past Chicago, the likely opponent becomes the Pacers. The last time Washington faced Indy was at the end of March, and the Wizards rolled to a 91-78 victory, so maybe there's a chance of pushing through the dead weight of Indy.\n\nThe Wizards wouldn't survive the Heat, but maybe some luck via an earlier upset by either the Bobcats, Raptors or Nets would make a trip to the finals at least plausible. Washington was a miserable 11-19 against the West, and didn't beat a single Western Conference playoff team at any point past early February (when they beat the Thunder and Blazers). So maybe that's the only hope of a Wizards title: a premier point guard battle between Wall and Westbrook that Durant sits out just to watch. OK, none of that is happening.\n\nHero-in-waiting: Hey Dirk, want another shot at an NBA title? OK, fine. Go play Gregg Popovich and his bench of neverending talent. Nowitzki can still take a game over, but he'll need to do it consistently through the entire playoffs.\n\nHow they win it all: These Mavericks don't have the talent of the 2010-11 squad that wiped the smirk off the Heat's dynasty kick-off party. They are old, lack athleticism and they start off against the league's best team. They're also the worst defensive team in the postseason.\n\nTo pull off a series win against San Antonio, the Mavs' offense is going to have to go video-game rookie mode and scorch the nets. Nowitzki and Monta Ellis have made a fantastic offensive pair in the pick-and-roll game, but they'll also need Vince Carter and Shawn Marion to play with an urgency like the early-bird buffet closes in five. Jose Calderon also better hit open 3s. Dallas can get hot for a game or two against the Spurs, but to win a title, it's going to have to take 16 games of defying improbability. But hey, if they can beat San Antonio, they can beat anyone -- how's that for a playoffs motto?\n\nHeroes-in-waiting: There are two. Kyle Lowry is a top-five point guard in the league, snubbed in the All-Star process but continuing to showcase his talent. DeMar DeRozan needs this postseason to reveal himself to the rest of North America. If these two get it going, the Raptors are capable of pushing through the East and into the finals.\n\nHow they win it all: There's a certain intensity that attaches to a team that feels disrespected. Toronto isn't getting credit for the season they've had because there's no clear analysis to say why they've been so successful (a symptom of a good system). Dwane Casey carrries that chip on his shoulder too, and his formula of efficiency up North propelled the Raptors to a top-10 ranking in both offense and defense in the regular season.\n\nThe Nets could be walking into a prehistoric bee's nest. If Toronto sticks to the script, and remains motivated, the Raptors could buzz through Brooklyn and then catch the Heat off guard next. Lowry can't negate a guy like LeBron, but he and DeRozan could. From there, the energetic and efficient Raptors could keep pushing through the finals. Keep in mind, Toronto actually carried a winning record against the West.\n\nHero-in-waiting: Mike Miller. Yes, Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol are the foundation here, and Mike Conley is a must. But last year they missed a closer late in games, and Miller has proven he can be that guy.\n\nHow they win it all: When a Grizzly bear pounds at a door long enough, eventually that thing's going to come down. Memphis is playoff-tested, the perfect model to win a title because of that interior \"grit\" and defensive \"grind.\" The Grizzlies aren't your everyday No. 7 seed. Since Gasol returned from his knee injury, the Grizzlies have been one of the West's best teams.\n\nThey drew the short straw in having to face the longest superstar in history, Kevin Durant. Unlike last season when Memphis knocked out OKC, this time KD comes with Russell Westbrook. That means the Grizzlies will need to make this dance one of the slow variety. If the Grizzlies play that brand and execute it without letting Durant go superhuman, they will beat the Thunder. A series win like that would set a nice tone for the rest of the postseason and could carry Memphis to a championship.\n\nHero-in-waiting: Stephen Curry got NBA Jam-hot during last year's playoff run and nearly took the Warriors to the Western Conference Finals because of it. He began his current heating-up process at the close of the regular season, and the Warriors will need another showcase from him if they have any hope of advancing this postseason.\n\nHow they win it all: For all the success Golden State has embraced the past two seasons, it's luck really has been downright awful. Last year they lost David Lee at the start of the playoffs, and this year they'll go without Andrew Bogut, their second most valuable player behind Curry. Golden State will be forced to go small or ride Jermaine O'Neal against a tough Clippers interior. That's not fantastic news.\n\nFor the Warriors to win a title, they'll need 1) their Splash Brothers to explode from behind the arc and 2) hope their top-three defensive rating can hold up without Bogut as a clog in the middle.\n\nActually, these things need to go right too: 3) Lee needs to overcome hamstring issues that have layered him with rust, 4) Andre Iguodala needs to be the offensive playmaker he was for Denver a year ago, 5) Harrison Barnes needs to shake off the funk he's endured much of the season and 6) Draymond Green needs to continue to overachieve. Arguably, all six of those things must happen if the Warriors have a Cinderella's hope at winning the title. Either that, or Bogut returns from injury. The odds don't look good, even if Curry goes off again.\n\nHero-in-waiting: Damian Lillard certainly has superstar stuff, and he could use this, his first playoffs, to launch himself even further into the league's elite. Remember what Stephen Curry did last postseason? Lillard has that type of juice.\n\nHow they win it all: The Blazers have no chance at a legit run unless they lock it up defensively. Portland spent the entire first half of the season surviving off its offense and just in the final 10 games began to show balance on the defensive side. Even then, it's really about how well Portland is shooting the ball. Like a classic mid-major in March Madness, the Blazers make runs by throwing 3-point hooks. This also happens to be a defensive weakness of the Rockets.\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge makes the Blazers' offense legitimate and consistent. If all things are clicking, it's a second-round meeting with the Spurs. If that's the case, Portland is really going to have to grow up quickly in a way that Golden State did only halfway last postseason. If a title shot dwells somewhere past San Antonio, it's going to come through newly inspired defense and a healthy measure of 3-pointers from Lillard, Wesley Matthews and Nicolas Batum.\n\nHero-in-waiting: D.J. Augustin has become the leading scorer for the Bulls, and if Chicago has any real hope at a title, he's going to have to provide even further offensive firepower.\n\nHow they win it all: Chicago can win a title because its defense really is that fantastic -- and so is Tom Thibodeau. There's a special energetic magic that pours out of his vocal chords (some call it intimidation). Opponents folded to the hardwood-cracking effort from the Bulls in February when Chicago was supposed to just go away, so imagine how that's going to intensify in the postseason.\n\nThe Bulls may intimidate the Wizards right off the court in the first round. A second-round matchup against the Pacers could look very much the same, as the Bulls enter the playoffs a much, much better team than Indiana. Unless the Pacers restore what once was, the Bulls could have a somewhat light path to an Eastern Conference Finals against the Heat.\n\nThat's where intimidation won't work, but defense and increased offense will. To beat Miami, the offense will have to be as collective and proficient as the defense. But if the Bulls get past the Heat, there's no reason they can't continue their upset tour through the finals. And no, Derrick Rose won't be necessary.\n\nHero-in-waiting: Deron Williams isn't supposed to be just some ancillary piece. He came to the Nets to be one of the league's elite point guards. As he goes, so will the Nets this postseason. This could be his opportunity to put a major stamp on his career.\n\nHow they win it all: These Nets were born out of unrealistic title expectations. Brooklyn paid a heavy price for experience and superstar names on the back of its jerseys. But despite the loss of Brook Lopez, the Nets still rallied behind depth and talent to surge up the standings in the second half of the season.\n\nIf they pull off the improbable, it's because those future Hall of Famers paid off. Paul Pierce can still morph into unguardable and devastate any defense. Kevin Garnett's leadership is an intangible that's already proven capable of guiding a championship run. More than that though, it's because the team's chemistry and ability to create mismatches will only further gel with every playoff win. Watch out, Heat. The Nets built this team with a certain \"Unseat the King\" motto, and they did go 4-0 against Miami in the regular season.\n\nHero-in-waiting: Dwight Howard had a good regular season, but imagine how dangerous these Rockets would be if he embodies the dominance of his Orlando days.\n\nHow they win it all: All the lovey-dovey \"we're super nice and fun\" stuff will fade if the Rockets don't impress this postseason. These Rockets were built to win an NBA championship, and there's a wealth of talent that leaves few excuses not to. They have their superstar scorer in James Harden. They have their elite center in Dwight Howard. The front court depth is there, Chandler Parsons is already playoff-tested as a scorer and guard Patrick Beverley is a menacing defender.\n\nBut collecting talent rarely turns into a championship unless: A) those superstars are of the LeBron James, Kevin Garnett or Shaquille O'Neal variety or B) they form a unique system channeled by efficiency and chemistry. That's going to mean Harden will have to carry this team on his shoulders in a way Dwyane Wade carried the Heat in their first title run. Howard will need to be dominant and Kevin McHale will have to answer the game plans of Terry Stotts and eventually Gregg Popovich.\n\nHero-in-waiting: Doc Rivers would receive Hall of Fame status if he is able to complete the job the Clippers hired him to do and win a championship.\n\nHow they win it all: The Clippers are far more balanced this season than they were entering last year's playoffs. Chris Paul doesn't have to do it all this time around. But if his play resembles the high-octane type from his brief postseason last year, as a pairing with the top-shelf play Blake Griffin showcased this regular season, the Clippers are going to be tough to oust.\n\nLos Angeles caught a bit of a break with the Bogut injury, making Golden State just that much less of a first-round threat. Had the Clippers actually moved into the second spot, they'd have been vulnerable to another boot from the interior thick Grizzlies. Either way though, they will need to get through either the Grizzlies or the Thunder. That won't be a problem if the Clippers offense continues to swarm the halfcourt and fly in transition with more offensive options than Blake Griffin commercials. L.A. has the superstars and the coaching to defeat the Spurs, Heat or whatever test awaits at the finish line.\n\nHero-in-waiting: Paul George has been taken on and off the A-list more than Kim Kardashian. He reached top-tier heights last postseason, carried the Pacers early into this season but has fallen off significantly. If the Pacers are to win the title, he needs to be the best player on the floor each night -- even when they're playing the Heat.\n\nHow they win it all: Indiana enters the playoffs with absolutely zero momentum except for the fact they were actually able to retain the No. 1 spot. However, that could be a major factor in navigating the East's fractured landscape. With the top spot, the Pacers score an under-.500 Hawks team and have some breathing room that even the Bobcats' defense could have suffocated. The first round might be enough runway to allow Indiana to restore some air underneath those tired wings.\n\nBut if the Pacers have any shot at reaching the Eastern Conference Finals again, eventually they have to get through the Heat. At least this time around they can do it at home, where they are still tough. Home court advantage won't mean anything though unless the Pacers identify whatever shattered their once succinct chemistry. It starts with Roy Hibbert's production in the middle. The Pacers won't contend without him and George playing at the level they did before the All-Star break.\n\nHero-in-waiting: Kevin Durant earned an MVP this regular season, but he'll only get ultimate respect if he wins a championship. He's still plenty young, but that title window can shrink at any moment in the NBA (just ask Carmelo Anthony), and it's time Durant starts to play under that level of urgency.\n\nHow they win it all: Here's a secret you won't find in highlight shows or shoe ads, but the real reason behind the Thunder's success is greater than Durant and Westbrook scoring. Shhhhh. OKC had a top-five defensive rating this season. It's not as provocative, but yes, OKC is actually a better defensive team than it is an offensive team.\n\nThe scoring from KD is inevitable, and so are the streaky scoring bunches from Westbrook. But it's Oklahoma City's ability to get after it defensively that will determine if the Thunder can advance past the toughness of the Grizzlies, the superstar-loaded offense of the Clippers or the proficiency of the Spurs. While that's a tough road, the Thunder will be pretty tested (or pretty exhausted) if a rematch versus the Heat sits as the final challenge. If Durant can do as he has done all season, and outdo even LeBron, the Thunder can win the title. But remember, the defense is just as important.\n\nHero-in-waiting: Kawhi Leonard was the X-factor for the Spurs last season. The attacking and defensively gifted wing for San Antonio wasn't even six years old when the Spurs drafted Tim Duncan, but now he could be the reason Duncan wins one final title.\n\nHow they win it all: Only the dagger of a Ray Allen 3-pointer stood in the way of the Spurs winning a championship last summer. You didn't expect these Spurs to simply fold, now did you? San Antonio is back healthier and perhaps more balanced than last season. They will win the NBA championship if they stay healthy, execute as they've been doing all season and avoid any wild heroics by opposing superstars.\n\nThe faces of unity continue to be Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili, while also including Leonard. But the system of San Antonio is simple: guys know where they will get their shots on any given night, and the team knows how to move the ball to get those shots. If the Spurs play their brand, they are the favorite in every series they step into -- no matter who they play.\n\nHero-in-waiting: LeBron James is the only guy in the league whose legacy is on the line every playoff game. No other player has proven he can carry his team to a title the way he has.\n\nHow they win it all: Nothing changes for the Heat this postseason. That regular-season shell has nothing to do with what Miami hopes to accomplish. All that stands in the way of a fourth consecutive finals appearance are three series victories against an airy East. Indiana has fallen apart, Chicago doesn't have the offense to keep up and the Nets are a challenge but may not survive the Raptors.\n\nThe path to the three-peat gets tougher in the finals, where one of these elite West teams will be waiting. But let's not get confused: LeBron is still the greatest player in the league. When he snaps into that man who took over the final games against the Spurs last season, he is impossible to hold back. Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and all other Miami players are just role players (albeit All-Star ones) to what LeBron is accomplishing. History is in the making, and anyone would be foolish to discount what the game's king is about to do.\n\nFollow Jimmy Spencer on Twitter: @JimmySpencerNBA", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nFrom the immortal words of Dumb and Dumber: \"So you're telling me there's a chance ...

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00010-of-00064--423", "original_text": "MANY painters seem indelibly linked to the cities in which they lived and worked, like Canaletto and Venice or Vermeer of Delft. But paintings are portable and, a few centuries on, can often be dispersed far and wide, which is why one quarter of Vermeers output can be seen today in a 10-block stretch of Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.\n\nYet while some of the works of the Spanish master Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes (1746-1828) have strayed into private collections and museums throughout Europe and the United States, many of his most iconic paintings remain in Madrid. Many are in the Prado museum, which through July 13 is showing Goya in Times of War to commemorate the Madrid uprising of May 2, 1808, which began Spains War of Independence against Napoleons forces.\n\nBut Goya, who served four Spanish monarchs through war and convulsive social and political upheaval, didnt begin at the Prado, and not all his works have ended up there. One can trace his trajectory and discover some of the hidden gems of Madrid by seeking out the Goyas that remain elsewhere in the city, including where the artist left them.\n\nAn artistic heir to the painterly virtuosity of Velázquez, Goya is revered above all for the candor of his works. In portraits he refused to flatter even his king and queen. In his prints and many of his paintings, he catalogued the privation and horror of war and the lesser urges of mankind. The central image of the more than 200 works on display at the Prado is The Third of May, portraying French firing squads executing Spanish civilians the day after the May 2 street rebellion. Two centuries later, the painting continues to haunt the collective psyche, having inspired later artists like Manet and Picasso.\n\nThe images Goya created have lost none of their power, said Manuela Mena, the Prados curator of 19th-century painting, who organized the show. There are painters today who feel that they are working right beside him.\n\nAnd indeed, for a visitor to Madrid its still possible to sidle up to Goya in some pretty surprising places. In looking for Goya in Madrid, one finds works that complement each other and give a wonderfully complete view of painting at Goyas time, said Janis Tomlinson, director of University Museums at the University of Delaware and an eminent Goya scholar.\n\nShe suggests starting a tour at the late 18th-century neo-Classical basilica of San Francisco el Grande, where the lateral chapels include an early altarpiece by Goya along with works by his contemporaries in the early 1780s. While the other artists are now known only to specialists, Dr. Tomlinson says that seeing the works ensemble gives us a picture of the art world in which Goya worked; it helps us see how Goya became Goya.\n\nIt even helps us see Goya, who painted himself into the altarpiece (hes the curly-haired figure at right looking out at the viewer), which depicts the sermon of St. Bernardino of Siena. The basilicas expansive dome has recently emerged radiant after a major restoration. The church appears in several Goya paintings like the Prados Pradera de San Isidro, in which its dome and bell towers rise above the citys western skyline much as they do today.\n\nWith the success of this altarpiece, Goya finally won entrance into the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, of which he became director of painting in 1797. A must for lovers of Spanish painting, the academy displays two of Goyas most intimate self-portraits among other key works. The building also houses the Calcografia, the printing establishment to which Goya sold the copper plates for his etchings of Los Caprichos, La Tauromaquia and Los Desastres de la Guerra.\n\nIn 1798, it was thus a more established Goya who decorated the dome of San Antonio de la Florida, a tiny hermitage church near the Manzanares River on what was then the outskirts of Madrid. He frescoed the entire interior, depicting a story from the life of the 12th-century St. Anthony of Padua populated with a charming array of 18th-century Madrileños. Goyas remains were interred here in 1919.\n\nIn 1799 Goya was made first court painter to King Charles IV, whose likeness, along with that of his wife, Queen Maria Luisa de Parma, stare out at us with bemused or muddled expressions from numerous portraits. One of the more noteworthy is in the Royal Palace on the Plaza de Oriente showing the queen dressed as a maja  a typical Madrileña  in traditional Spanish black attire with a mantilla. Others quickly followed the Italian-born queen in co-opting the dress of commoners to show their allegiance to Spain. Today, its far more common to hear such garb  the mantilla, mens woolen capes and small hats called monteras  described as goyesca after Goya. Its also not uncommon for Infanta Elena, the eldest daughter of King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofía, to turn up at gala functions dressed a la goyesca, thereby guaranteeing herself pages of adoring praise in the pages of gossip magazines.\n\nAnother Spaniard whose pedigree remains above reproach is the 17th duchess of Alba, a Spanish grandee 35 times over, whose Madrid residence, the Liria Palace, is home to one of Goyas most iconic images. His portrait of the 13th duchess  believed by some to have been both Goyas lover and the model for the Naked Maja  is on loan to the Prado show. The palace  which also houses works by Titian, Rubens, Rembrandt and Velázquez  offers tours to a lucky 45 visitors a week; there is a waiting list of about two years.\n\nLess grand is the Museo Lázaro-Galdiano, one of the few former private collections intact and in its original home, in the posh shopping district known as the Barrio Salamanca. Emblematic of the palacetes or little palaces fashionable at the turn of the 20th century in Madrid, the Lázaro-Galdiano reopened several years ago after a restoration returned it to its highly gilded glory. Its Goyas include some of the charmingly eerie witchcraft scenes that exemplify his dark, personal works of the 1790s, after an unknown illness left the artist deaf. These small oil paintings on tin were commissioned by the Duke and Duchess of Osuna, whose former country retreat, La Alameda de Osuna, today finds itself well within Madrids ever expanding footprint, making it quite easy to visit.\n\nThough the Osuna house is not open to the public, the 18th-century-French-style garden, known as El Capricho de la Alameda de Osuna, has become a favorite public park that beautifully evokes the genteel pastimes enjoyed by the Spanish nobility, many of whom were Goyas loyal customers. The garden includes a small artificial lake and river on which the duchess often ferried her guests in small boats from the main house downriver to lunch in the Chinese-style dining pagoda or to parties in the octagonal dancing pavilion.\n\nPerhaps the best place to wind down a Goya tour is where his career actually began, at the Royal Tapestry Factory. Before his altarpiece in San Francisco el Grande brought him greater recognition, Goya worked as a salaried painter of tapestry designs, called cartoons, creating more than 60 such compositions for the decoration of new palaces being built by the Bourbon kings. His designs, which mostly depict hunting scenes, carnival themes or frolicking children, still sell quite well today at 12,000 euros (roughly $19,000) a square meter.\n\nA visit to the tapestry workshop, not far from the Atocha rail station, is to step back in time as one walks amid the teams of weavers working on large looms, some nearly 300 years old. Upstairs, thousands of skeins of yarn are warehoused according to color batches, so that any tapestry or carpet made here since its founding in 1720 can be repaired if need be with the original yarn.\n\nThe cartoons are shown at the Prado (in the second-floor galleries), but to see the vividly hued tapestries requires a visit to one of the two royal palaces for which they were commissioned. An hour north of Madrid at San Lorenzo de El Escorial is the 18th-century Palace of the Bourbons, a vast suite of intimate yet elaborately decorated rooms carved out of the former stables of the austere 16th-century monastery built by the Hapsburg King Phillip II. Closer to the city gates is the Palace of El Pardo, a once-rustic royal hunting lodge expanded and modernized over the centuries and the former residence of Francisco Franco. Finding Goyas early tapestries  with their sumptuous colors and lighthearted Rococo subjects  juxtaposed with a 20th-century dictators austere 1940s aesthetic rather tidily sums up the extremes of both Goyas career and Spains more recent history.\n\nSo was Goya the last of the old masters or the first modern one? Does it matter? said Manuela Mena of the Prado. He was a master.\n\nMuseo del Prado, Paseo del Prado; (34-90) 210-7077; www.museodelprado.es; admission 6 euros, $7.60 at $1.62 to the euro.\n\nBasilica of San Francisco el Grande, Plaza de San Francisco; (34-91) 365-3400; tour, 3 euros.\n\nSan Antonio de la Florida, Paseo de San Antonio de la Florida 5; (34-91) 542-0722; free.\n\nMuseum of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, Calle Alcalá 13; (34-91) 524-0864; rabasf.insde.es; 3 euros.\n\nRoyal Palace, Calle Bailén; (34-91) 542-8800; www.patrimonionacional.es; 10 euros.\n\nLiria Palace House of Alba Foundation, Calle Princessa 20; (34-91) 547-5302.\n\nMuseo Lazaro-Galdiano, Serrano 122; (34-91) 561-6084; www.flg.es; 4 euros.\n\nEl Capricho de la Alameda de Osuna, Paseo de la Alameda de Osuna; free.\n\nRoyal Tapestry Factory, Calle Fuenterrabia 2; (34-91) 434-0550; www.realfabricadetapices.com; 3.50 euros.\n\nRoyal Palace of El Pardo, Calle Manuel Alonso, Monte de El Pardo; (34-91) 376-1500; www.patrimonionacional.es; 4 euros.\n\nEl Escorial, Calle Juan de Borbón y Battemberg, San Lorenzo de El Escorial; (34-91) 890-5902; www.patrimonionacional.es; 10 euros.\n\nHotel de las Letras, Gran Via 11; (34-91) 523-7980; www.hoteldelasletras.com; doubles from 155 euros.\n\nHotel Husa Paseo del Arte, Atocha 123; (34-91) 298-4800; www.hotelhusapaseodelarte.com; doubles from 110 euros.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nMANY painters seem indelibly linked to the cities in which they lived and worked, like Canaletto and Venice or Vermeer of Delft.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00003-of-00064--86", "original_text": "Archive: Post Politics Hour discussion transcripts\n\nPaul Kane: Good morning, folks. Wow, the news on Capitol Hill is just, well, I don't know. Over the years now I've written about DOJ/FBI investigations into Torricelli, Stevens, Abramoff and his cronies, and sex scandals involving Larry Craig and now Ensign, and I think there are some others that I'm forgetting. Oh, Vitter. I'm beginning to think, You know, maybe it's not them; maybe it's me. Maybe I'm the cause of all this, the way the hatch's magnetic forces in LOST caused all those plane crashes, somehow I'm the guy who's got this magnetic force propelling these guys into acting so badly. Or maybe I'm just a reporting deviant and I like writing about these bad things.\n\nOK, enough navel gazing. On to your questions. And I promise to write about more than just the Ensign scandal and the rain-plagued U.S. Open.\n\nDes Peres, Mo.: Hey, Paul. How seriously do you take these most recent polls that suggest the public is either tiring or becoming suspicious of the President's many programs? More importantly, does Congress take those polls into account when they decide how much they should oppose a presidential initiative? Thanks.\n\nPaul Kane: OK, lots of Obama-poll questions. The Republicans love the new info, and the line of last night -- which a senior GOP aide emailed me at 7:45 last night after watching Hardball -- was \"the honeymoon is over.\"\n\nI'm not so sure that's the case, but let's face it, the American people are still scared. The slow-and-steady climb of the stock market this year has done little make voters feel secure -- given the fact that it's still down 40 percent or so from the 14,000-high of a couple years ago.\n\nAnd they see the huge deficits, the takeover of GM/Chrysler, and they worry about things.\n\nSo this shows that Obama is taking ownership of these issues, now that he's been president for 6 months or so. The voters don't see this as a Bush-era problem. They aren't demanding immediate perfection, but slowly but surely they aren't buying this as a Bush-era problem.\n\nRockville, Md.: How much longer do you think it will take for the late night hosts to kid about Obama the way they did about W and Bill?\n\nPaul Kane: Well, in terms of the late-night folks, just watch Stewart on Daily Show. Because he's the leading edge of all late-night comedy. His routine is more bawdy, and he'll do the curse thing in which they bleep out the F word or the P word, etc. But Stewart is without question a dyed-in-the-wool liberal, but he's got no beef turning on Democrats. (Ask Nancy Pelosi's staff about watching Stewart's commentaries over the CIA-briefing issue last month, known here in this chat affectionately as LollaPelosi.)\n\nCroton-on-Hudson, N.Y.: What's your view on Sen. Durbin's statement that banks \"own this place\"?\n\nPaul Kane: Durbin is very, very frustrated by his inability to win enough support for his provision to allow bankruptcy judges to modify mortgages on primary residences. It's been a cause of his for a couple years now, and the banking industry has battled him at every turn, knocking him down each time he tries to get this passed. The industry has effectively labeled it \"cram down\", the derogatory term meaning judges could cram down interest rates and banks would have no say over things.\n\nThis has infuriated Durbin, leading to him to charge that the banks are just so powerful, even in their current lousy condition, that they \"own\" Capitol Hill.\n\nAs for his own investments, this was a very tricky move that Durbin pulled after getting his own briefing about the state of the economy last fall.\n\nMadison, Wis.: Mr. Kane, thanks for taking questions. I'm greedy so I'm going to ask two and you can decide which, if any, you want to answer:\n\n1. What have you heard regarding the recent firing of Gerald Walpin, the Inspector General responsible for the Corporation for National and Community Service, the organization that runs AmeriCorps? Republicans are claiming this action was strictly political and intended to protect a contributor to the Obama campaign.\n\n2. Why are Republicans now demanding a return of the Fairness Doctrine (in regards to the president's upcoming interview on healthcare on ABC News)?\n\nPaul Kane: I really don't know the answer to either question, but I picked your questions as a way to lecture those folks who want to be reporters. Never ask a politician a 2-part question. It's a failing of many, many reporters. Watch the next Obama live press conference and watch how many reporters naively ask 2-parters. The reality is that gives Obama/politicians options, so they choose to answer the question that they want to answer, talk forever on that question and then simply point into the audience of reporters and say \"next question\" without ever answering the question he/she didn't want to answer. Settle on your 1 question, firmly ask that and, if you get a chance, poke your way in for a follow up. That's my motto.\n\nI guess \"what happens in Las Vegas stays in Las Vegas\" doesn't help you if you happen to live in Las Vegas. I never saw Ensign as serious presidential candidate, but what do I know? Will this hurt his senate re-election chances?\n\nPaul Kane: I've always wanted to ask Ensign or Reid that question, whether the what-happens-in-Vegas motto applies to those that live there! By the way, a couple months ago, my buddies and I went to Vegas for a bachelor party, had a blast, but then we came home and the bachelor himself -- yes, the bachelor -- told his fiancÃ© everything that happened. It's ok, there were no laws broken, nothing really bad happened. He was on pretty good behavior, but what the heck? Doesn't that violate some federal law?\n\nOkay, as for Ensign, he falls into the Vitter level of scandal here. If nothing else comes out, if the whispers of demands for money don't turn into something bigger, if this is just a sex scandal, Ensign can easily hunker down and ride this out without any fear of having to resign.\n\nIt happened right in the middle of his 6-year term, just like when Vitter got caught in the D.C. Madam web in 2007 -- both men had/have 3 years to rehab themselves before facing their home-state voters again.\n\nBoston: How is it that a couple of Senators from states that are as populous as small- to mid-sized cities get to control our country's health care debate? Of course as a civics geek I know why, but it is just galling. They have no opposition and they are just out there reaming their own party, their own president and 75 percent of the American populace.\n\nPaul Kane: Hahahaha. It is amazing, when you look at the Senate Finance Committee, how rural the composition of it is. It's amazing, Baucus from Montana, Grassley from Iowa. Jay Rockefeller from W. Va., Conrad from North Dakota, Jeff Bingaman from New Mexico. You gotta go to the 5th most senior Dem on the panel to find Boston's own John Kerry as a coastal liberal, and he's immediately followed by Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas. On the GOP side of the aisle, Grassley is followed by Hatch of Utah, Snowe of Maine, Kyl of Arizona and then Bunning of Kentucky, Crapo of Idaho and Roberts of Kansas.\n\nLots of middle earth in there.\n\nLos Angeles, Calif.: When asked the other day in a Post Q&A about Obama's mendaciousness with the LBGT community your Michael D. Shear said we'd \"come around\" eventually because \"After all, where else do they have to go?\"\n\nDo you share his cynically dismissive take?\n\nPaul Kane: I didn't read Shear's online chat so I can't assume what he meant, but I'd just say that some Democrats probably go take the gay vote for granted. Obviously they are not going to go vote for Republicans, the thinking goes, so you don't have to give in to all their demands.\n\nHowever, clearly they could decide to not cut checks and not cast their votes, and it would probably require some leading figures in that community, prominent out Hollywood figures, to take the first bold steps and launch the protest. That would be a real consequence to the Democratic inaction on this agenda.\n\nGOP outrage at ABC: Republicans are currently really angry that ABC TV is going to do a program on Obama and is not giving them equal time to share their own opinions. Do you think Republicans would support a law that requires broadcasters to give equal time to opposing viewpoints like the GOP's? A \"Fairness Doctrine\" of sorts?\n\nPaul Kane: Yeah, sorry to the question earlier that raised this point in the 2-parter that I kinda mocked. Sorry, this ABC thing I understand.\n\nLook, let's set aside the issue of \"Fairness Doctrine\" for the moment, and whether there should be a new law setting clear bright lines on this. But what ABC is doing, a daylong broadcast from the White House, simply would not be tolerated if this were the other way around.\n\nImagine the scenario of, say, back in May 2003, after he rode shotgun onto the flight deck of the aircraft carrier and declared \"Mission Accomplished\", imagine if W came home to the White House and had Fox News do a 24-hour broadcast from the West Wing.\n\nSorry, that would have been pummeled, mocked, humiliated, etc. I don't think ABC should be getting away with what they're doing now.\n\nChicago, Ill.: Is it just me, or are some Republican pundits actually siding with Ahmedinejad? It occurs to me that if Mousavi prevails, then Obama may get a regime he can negotiate with, thus helping in establishing peace in the region. They (Republicans) would lose an another pillar of their foreign policy doctrine. Could this Iran election/Cairo speech be Obama's Reagan moment in Berlin (Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall)?\n\nPaul Kane: Sorry, I've been so deep into the weeds of both looking at lawmakers' financial disclosure forms and trying to root out conflicts of interest, and then following the Ensign scandal, that I'm just not completely up to speed on Iran. I've got a basic enough view of what's going on over there, but I can't really give an expert opinion on the matter.\n\nHowever, I'll say this much about the coverage of this whole Iranian \"election\" scandal. When did Iran become a democracy? The entire point of the Iraq invasion, I thought, once the WMDs were proved to be bunk, was to establish a beach-head of democracy in the Middle East -- the presumption being there was no democracy there.\n\nWhy are we so outraged that there were election irregularities there in Iran? This wasn't Florida in 2000.\n\nElizabeth Becton: Paul, please get people to stop calling me Liz!\n\nPaul Kane: No name calling\n\nI've been so hunkered down in this Ensign stuff that I haven't had the chance yet to fully engage in this e-mail shout fest. People, e-mail is a bad, bad thing. Think three times before you hit the send button: How would this look if it were posted on a gossip blog?\n\nSalinas, Calif.: Hi Paul. After reading Dana Milbank's account of Senate Republicans ducking comment regarding John Ensign's confession of adultery, (\"Complicating the task was The Post's Paul Kane, who stood in the doorway between senators and their lunch.\"), two questions came to mind: 1. Do you tend goal on Post hockey weekends? 2. After Craig and Vitter were able to weasel their way out of having to resign (John Edwards' career prospects, not so bright), will their constituents at home finally reach a threshold of disgust that leads them to \"hate the sin, not the sinner\", but throw the hypocrite out anyway? (Gay and lesbian couples in decades-long committed relationships must wonder what it's going to take to get past these conservative culture warriors.)\n\nwashingtonpost.com: In the GOP Caucus, Prayers for the Sinner -- but Mostly Silence\n\nPaul Kane: Dana has written many of these Sketches before, he and I jokingly call them the \"perp walk\" sketch. Member of Congress -- Vitter, Stevens, Craig, Jefferson, etc. -- gets into some form of trouble, then returns to Congress and gets chased around by TV cameras and reporters.\n\nBut this time, there was no perp to do the walk, since Ensign remains in his bunker in Vegas, baby, Vegas. So Dana pretty much told me and my friend Jessica Brady of Roll Call that he was going to sketch us asking the GOP what they thought of Ensign. Turned out kinda funny, I hope.\n\nAs for me and goal-tender, no, never really did that. Except when I was kid growing up with 4 older brothers, there was some floor hockey played in our basement, in which it was 2-on-2, and sometimes they made me, the youngest, play goaltender. I'd take old couch cushions we had in the basement, tie them around my legs with my Dad's old ties, and pretend to be Bernie Parent.\n\nGuess it was good practice for blocking senators headed into lunch.\n\nBethesda, Md.: \"When did Iran become a democracy?\"\n\nWell, it was until about 1953...\n\nPaul Kane: Thanks, thanks for both giving me the historical reference point -- and also making my point. If Bethesda is correct, we've had 56 years of non-democracy there. I\"m not in any way suggesting what's happening there is good, or just, I'm just saying that from my completely non-expert eye, it looks like some of the media coverage is over heated.\n\nI lived in Beijing for a year, in 1994, and I'm well aware that they also have elections in China. And they are frauds, but I've never seen the media go crazy when these Chinese \"elections\" are held.\n\nABC: Shouldn't we wait until after the airing of the program to criticize or mock it? We know what we would have gotten if Fox did a show about W, but do we know yet what we'll get from ABC?\n\nPaul Kane: Sorry, I just don't think I agree. If ABC goes in there and does a highly critical set of pieces on Obama, I'll be stunned. Was there a quid-pro-quo, Starling, involved here? No, definitely not.\n\nBut the act of actually broadcasting from the seat of the government, to me, just appears to be so deep into the pocket of the Obama administration, that it's just not right. What if Harry Reid gave me a desk in his majority leader's office and I worked from his personal office? All the other reporters worked up on the 3rd floor of the Senate press gallery, except me, I worked downstairs on the 2nd floor in Reid's office, filed my stories from there.\n\nI don't think that would fly. And I don't think ABC should be broadcasting from the White House.\n\nAnonymous: Just wanted to say that piece on John Edwards was incredible. Excellent work!\n\nPaul Kane: Hope From a Humbler Perch\n\nThere's Alec MacGillis's piece on Edwards. For some reason Edwards was eager to talk to Alec, so much so that Alec had to leave a farewell happy hour for one of our editors Friday night, at 9 o'clock, because Edwards was gonna call him for the story.\n\nI just can't get over the entire Edwards' family fall from grace. They once appeared to be the southern version of the Kennedys, the next generation of Camelot.\n\nNow, they're the Beverly Hillbillies.\n\nWashington, D.C.: What Springsteen song best encapsulates the Ensign scandal?\n\nPaul Kane: Brilliant Disguise, without a question. Read those lyrics, and read them from Darlene Ensign's perspective, think of her greeting the senator coming home late one night. For the times when Bruce sings 'woman', insert 'man'. Painful stuff:\n\nI heard somebody call your name\n\nI saw something tucked in shame\n\nWell I've tried so hard baby\n\nbut I just can't see\n\nWhat a woman like you\n\nSo tell me who I see\n\nwhen I look in your eyes\n\nor just a brilliant disguise\n\nBad behavior of politicians: Does the bad behavior of politicians stem in part from their need for adulation -- why they may have gone into politics in the first place? And, conversely, does their power become the \"aphrodisiac\" that makes them attractive to these staffers that trip them up?\n\nPaul Kane: Ah, this is one of the oldest questions there is, is it the chicken or the egg?\n\nIt's hard to tell, and I have to take a cop out here and suggest that it's both. In some cases these men are always in pursuit of adulation, and that leads them into these situations. David Maraniss, in his biographies of Bill Clinton, makes clear that he was always a womanizer, that it was part of his existence.\n\nJohn Edwards, on the other hand, has said that he wasn't that way until he got into politics and saw the adulation that others gave him, that it caused him to change, to morph into something he wasn't. We can argue about whether Edwards was telling the truth, but I think he definitely described an accurate portrayal of why some male politicians stray.\n\nHow do we get Iran to go green and say no to nukes?: A single nuclear weapon can ruin your entire day?\n\nHow do we stop Iran from becoming the Wal-Mart of nuclear weapons to terrorists on a budget?\n\nPaul Kane: If I knew the answer to this question, I wouldn't be sitting here chatting with you guys, I'd be down at Foggy Bottom telling Secretary Clinton what to say.\n\nArlington, Va.: Good Morning Mr. Kane: Foley, Vitter, Craig and Ensign. Could these be the 4 Horsemen of the Republican Apocalypse? As the party's standing continues to erode in just released opinion surveys, might the shenanigans of some of its members diminish its chances in races for governor this fall and the mid-term 2010 elections?\n\nPaul Kane: A couple of you have pointed out Mark Foley. Wow, I forgot about him. But I'm sorry, folks, this is not just a Republican thing, Democratic male politicians are also dogs. Look at Clinton and Edwards and Gary Hart. The Republicans have a slightly more difficult problem because they often are social conservatives, espousing family values. Ensign went to Promise Keeper events, where the very existence of the group is meant to treat women better. Incidentally, I'm told Ensign headlined a Promise Keeper event with Randall Cunningham, No. 12 for the Philadelphia Eagles back in the '80s and '90s. Man, I loved the way that guy played QB, it was awesome.\n\nfull-day for ABC? Thought it was an hour in prime-time...: Funny, Paul. I've only heard about ABC's plans to broadcast \"a primetime hour from the White House devoted to exploring and probing the President's position and giving voice to questions and criticisms of that position.\" What's this day-long thing you and Matt Drudge and the GOP are so incensed about?\n\nPaul Kane: Just so everyone's clear, the entire ABC news operation will be housed inside the White House. GMA, World News Tonight, and then prime time.\n\nDunn Loring, Va.: Last year, when gas prices were steadily increasing, the Post and other media outlets had daily reports on the issue. Now, gas prices have risen 50 days in a row and yet there's no similar outcry. Other than a change in administration, is there any explanation for the difference in coverage?\n\nPaul Kane: Gas has risen from something like $2 a gallon, to $2.60, roughly.\n\nLast summer it topped $4.\n\nSo, do the math. That's why the coverage hasn't been anywhere near the same. But trust me, once we get over $3 a gallon, you'll see more stories, and if it gets to $3.50, Obama will have a full-blown crisis on his hands.\n\nHell's Kitchen, NYC: So the GOP objected en masse to increased funding to the IMF to help aid nations through the financial crisis, calling it \"a global bailout.\" How about the fact that this financial crisis was largely caused by the United States? Doesn't that trouble House conservatives at all?\n\nPaul Kane: The House Republicans have gone into a very old fashioned, protectionist, populist stance this year. I'm not sure if it's just a stance in opposition to Obama, or if this is a long-term refashioning of the GOP. It's a story to watch, and its origins begin with the first vote on the $700 billion bailout last September, the vote that failed when only 1/3 of House Republicans, 65 members, supported the bill. The markets tanked afterward, and many Republicans said, Fine.\n\nPaul Kane: OK gang, that's the hour, time for me to get moving. Questions were all over the map today, literally, from Iran to Vegas. Good thing I accidentally bought the venti coffee this morning. As always, I appreciate the time spent with everyone. And I'll see you back here in 2 weeks, on July 2, which coincidentally is the first day of Tiger Woods' PGA Tour event here in D.C. Shhh, don't tell my editors, but I'm thinking that I might get \"sick\" and not be able to do anything other than this chat on those days when the tourney is here in D.C. -pk\n\nEditor's Note: washingtonpost.com moderators retain editorial control over Discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions. washingtonpost.com is not responsible for any content posted by third parties.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nArchive: Post Politics Hour discussion transcripts Paul Kane: Good morning, folks.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00009-of-00064--1081", "original_text": "The immediate aftermath of the Belgium game saw conflicting feelings. Pride in the way the team fought to retrieve the two-goal deficit in extra time, with an insistence that a rush to judgment was somehow unseemly in the circumstances. However, a smaller but vehement group wanted to hold Jürgen Klinsmann to account for not providing the change in style promised after 2010.\n\nWhether some of the latter is down to the resistance that Klinsmann the cheerfully ruthless modernizer has encountered, is open to question, and as a foreigner replacing establishment man Bob Bradley, he needed every bit of his reputation to deal with the politics of US soccer.\n\nBut a fair amount of indulgence was given to Klinsmann by those, such as myself, who felt that he deserved to take the team through at least one World Cup before a full progress report be attempted. Tournament play is its own animal, and sometimes the teams who do well are those best organized to their collective strengths.\n\nOn that measure, Klinsmann getting the team out of a group that contained Ghana, Portugal and Germany, is a successful base camp for what comes next, and gives him enough of a mandate to continue with his task of “connecting the dots”, as he described his technical development task to me in April.\n\nWhether the team did so in a significantly distinct style from 2010 is open to question. Against Ghana and Belgium we even saw glimpses of “Bora-ball” — Bora Milutinovic's 1994 blueprint of a hard-working, scrambling defense played by an overmatched side fighting to make the most of occasional counters.\n\nBut against Portugal in particular we saw a version of what Klinsmann wants the team to be. Compact and tenacious in defense, explosive in attack. In extra time against Belgium there were more glimpses of what this side could be.\n\nThere isn’t an easy solution. Had the USA abandoned their defensive duties earlier in the game against Belgium, or in one late flurry against Germany, they could have been cut to pieces on the counter. But the longer they spent on the back foot, the harder it seemed to be to find the self-belief. Part of Klinsmann’s task before 2018 is to develop a side more secure in imposing their game in more than fleeting episodes.\n\nBut it is his task. The coach may have ruffled a lot of feathers, but he did enough in getting out of this particular group stage to earn the right to see his project through.\n\nIn the end only two outfield players didn’t see the field: Mix Diskerud and Timothy Chandler.\n\nChandler may have played himself out of contention with a rough outing against Turkey last month, and was kept out by DaMarcus Beasley rolling back the years in his fourth World Cup.\n\nDiskerud had offered sparks of confidence and vision in midfield over the past year, but it was Julian Green who Klinsmann turned to to provide a spark of inspiration against Belgium. Green grabbed a goal, but his introduction proved that Klinsmann was prepared to trust him in the most testing of circumstances.\n\nGreen’s introduction did raise another hypothetical posed by those criticizing the final 23 — if the USA was in a hole late on in a knockout game, was there anyone better than Landon Donovan to come off the bench? Donovan was the most visible of those who failed to make the final roster, but his age and reduced fitness capacity was always likely to clash with Klinsmann’s emphasis on willing runners. Green’s goal at least silenced some of those criticisms.\n\nMaurice Edu missed out on the final squad, on the gamble that Geoff Cameron’s versatility could see him play in defense or midfield. On paper, it left a squad once packed with defensive midfielders slightly bereft of them, given the more attacking roles handed to Michael Bradley and Jermaine Jones. In the event, Klinsmann’s faith in Kyle Beckerman worked out, as the midfielder had an excellent personal tournament until being omitted against Belgium in favor of the height of Cameron.\n\nDeAndre Yedlin caught the eye as a willing substitute — fast, strong and fearless going forward from right back. He still has a lot to learn on the defensive side and can be caught out up the field too often. But for seizing his chance, Yedlin deserves a lot of credit. Ditto John Brooks.\n\nIt’s in attack that the USA looked most stretched by the roster selection. Aron Johansson looked lost covering for the injured Altidore against Ghana. Clint Dempsey worked hard up front by himself, but Altidore’s injured hamstring left his team mates and coach hamstrung. Chris Wondolowski is a poacher, rather than a player to hold up the ball, and there were no other dedicated forwards on the team.\n\nShould Klinsmann have taken Eddie Johnson? He has an impressive renaissance at Seattle, but the face is Johnson has been in wretched form for DC United. Klinsmann took the strikers in form and when required trusted them to do a job. The rest was down to them.\n\nIn February I attended a pre-season media day at New York’s Red Bull Arena, where each MLS team was represented by a player or two. What was remarkable was the sheer number of national team players recently returned to, or opting to stay in the league — a phase that started with Clint Dempsey coming to Seattle and continued via Michael Bradley. Others such as Landon Donovan, Graham Zusi and Omar Gonzalez had signed new contracts with the league.\n\nKlinsmann, of course, had been famously ambivalent about the ambitions of the returnees, and notably a number of players on the bubble of the roster who elected to make their final push for Brazil in MLS, missed out: Maurice Edu, Clarence Goodson, Michael Parkhurst spring to mind — and of course Donovan didn’t make the final 23 either.\n\nAnd ambivalence has been the hallmark of Klinsmann’s relationship with the league — and watching him negotiate that ambivalence has been one of the most fascinating parts of the World Cup cycle, given his dual role as national team coach and director of technical development for US Soccer. Without the latter role we might have seen a different squad in Brazil, more akin to the rinse and repeat World Cup cycles we’re used to — where 30 players are found somewhere, anywhere, and reorganized and reshaped until somewhere a team emerges.\n\nBut Klinsmann seemed to realize that for better or worse, MLS is where the widening of the useable talent base will take place. Over the course of his reign his relationship with the league’s players changed — especially as he worked out the engine room of the compact style he wants to play.\n\nIn particular, Gonzalez, Matt Besler and Beckerman fought their way into the squad– but several other players made their way into the roster too. From four MLS players in the 2010 roster to half of the provisional roster coming from the league, the indication was of exponential improvement.\n\nYes, the growth is piecemeal, and the rapid expansion of the league brings as many worries about dilution of talent as increased opportunities for players. But from the academies, through to the reserves, to MLS, to the national team, there’s at least something like a path being worn by the current generation. Part of Klinsmann’s developmental remit in the next four years will be to widen that path.\n\nIn Philip Lahm’s autobiography, the Bayern Munich player was critical of his former national team and club coach Jürgen Klinsmann for concentrating too much on fanatical fitness regimes. It was a claim that played into the “Klinsmann is a motivator and Löw a tactician” mythology that gained traction in the wake of the 2006 World Cup, and it’s a claim which had since become something of an orthodoxy.\n\nBut then Klinsmann's regimes are still in use at Germany and Bayern. Moreover, Löw’s tactical adjustments, in this tournament at least, have not always suggested the mind of a master.\n\nKlinsmann’s emphasis on fitness is still intact. The preparation in team camp was sustained and intense, and the coach and senior players spoke of the edge that might be gained deep in games.\n\nBelgium, the late-goal specialists, were arguably the ultimate test of this belief, and while the USA were forced into attack by trailing early in extra time, they also had the Belgians reeling for the second period.\n\nBradley, who had run more than any player in the tournament (to little discernible effect, claimed many) finally looked to be pulling strings and still full of running in extra time — though that sight, and the sight of a panicky Belgian back four, also served to remind those watching of what might already have been a fatal timidity earlier in the game.\n\nBut if the US were conditioned to battle their way out of a grueling group to at least have a puncher’s chance in the knockouts, then the tournament was a modest success on that front, with a few important caveats. When Altidore pulled up with his hamstring strain, then Besler was withdrawn soon after in the opening game, legitimate questions could be asked about the intensity of the team’s preparations — when injuries that are often fatigue-related were occurring in the first half of the first group game.\n\nWhen Fabian Johnson picked up a similar injury in what proved to be the final game, it appeared understandable, but inevitably it brought to mind the memory of the first game and the question of over-training. Klinsmann earned the right for continuity in his overall project, and the right to find incremental advantages wherever he can, but with that, and a greater understanding of how far he got his team in one World Cup cycle, comes some increased scrutiny of his methods in the next one.\n\nIt’s the nature of knockout games that “what ifs” become the hooks we hang the stories of a tournament on. Besler bouncing off the rampaging Lukaku, the beautifully worked extra time free-kick that saw Dempsey’s shot smothered by Thibault Courtois, Green’s dramatic introduction, a montage memory of Tim Howard blocks, Chris Wondolowski’s late miss – these will inevitably be recast as the isolated incidents that tell the story of the Belgium game – and the tournament by extension.\n\nWondolowski claimed to have “let down” his team after the game, but he shouldn’t carry that moment with him. Wondolowski was intended as a substitute for the Dempsey role, not to take his place as an ineffective target man. The sad irony for him is that the one chance he got in the box was actually a typical knockdown for a poacher like him, after Jermaine Jones had done a passable impersonation of the big man in the box.\n\nAnd while the fan in any of us remembers those individual goals and misses, it’s unfair to blame Wondolowski for the USA’s exit. You can argue he’s on the field to take the one chance he gets, but there are several Belgian players heading into the next round who were given rather more spurned chances to make an impact, with no significant dents to their individual reputations. They wore down USA to where Lukaku’s introduction was a tipping point – and they’ll be assessed accordingly. Now that the dust has settled a little, the same should go for the USA.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nThe immediate aftermath of the Belgium game saw conflicting feelings.

His journalism career includes editing roles at The Post and Inc. magazine. He was founding publisher and editor of The Boston Observer, a monthly journal of liberal opinion. He got his start in journalism reporting for two New Hampshire newspapers -- the Concord Monitor and the Foster's Daily Democrat. Pearlstein has also worked as a television news reporter and a congressional staffer.\n\nHis column archive is online here.\n\nDanvers, Mass.: Yes. Filed this column under HTWW (How The World Works).\n\nBut, the reason why, in the face of inevitable loss, businesses continue to act out your script ... could it have something to do with them taking enough money off the table before the regulatory costs finally arrive? Could it be that the judicial costs rarely amount to much in the cold calculation of rate of return on the corrupt deals?\n\nSteven Pearlstein: It is possible the profits made during the boom periods, when standards are lax, more than offset the \"costs\" of having to clean things up once the public and government turn against an industry. That would be an interesting calculation. But to do it, you have to consider a lot of intangibles, chief among them the reputation of the industry and its ability to lobby effectively across a range of issues in the future. Those issue can also involve big money, and losing on them because the industry is in bad odor can be expensive. There are also the impact on people's careers, and the ability to attract and retain people to the industry. I guess I have trouble believing at this point, for example, that the mortgage industy thinks it is better off the way things turned out than to have taken action to reign in some of the worst practices that led to the deterioration of underwriting standards. They would have foregone some business, but not enough to justify the cost of the collapse of the subprime market that has resulted, and the effect of that on the housing market, which in turn impacts the vitality of their basic prime mortgage businesses.\n\nSilver Spring, Md.: Great column Steve. But I have to ask... where were the regulators in all of this? You say trade associations are supposed to protect members from themselves, prevent things from getting to such a bad point, and it would be wonderful if that always worked. But while my tax dollars certainly shouldn't go to protect corporations from themselves, I'd sure be happy if some more of them went to protecting me, the consumer, from them! Where were the regulators that should have kept those student loan lenders from getting in bed with my college, so perhaps I'd have a more competative choice? Where were the regulators to prevent mortgage companies from marketing a half a million dollar mortgage for 1500 /month knowing darn well that many many people are not well versed enough in finance to realize that payment's going to double when the interest only period is over? What in the world happened to protecting consumers from these sorts of practices BEFORE they got out of hand that our only hope is trade assocations?\n\nSteven Pearlstein: That, of course, is a separate issue. The banking regulators were clearly not vigilant enough, and have effectively admitted as such. The regulators at the Department of Education look, at this point, as if they were in the business of protecting the industry rather than borrowers. The health care issue is more complicated. Some of it involves behavior of state-licensed brokers. The health insurance industry has set up best practices that many of them used to screen out business from bad brokers. But the issue there also concerns whether there should be so-called fee-for-service plans under the Medicare Advantage program, since the view of many who have looked at it is that these don't add any value to the traditional medicare program beyond additional benefits that are paid for by additional subsidies (minus, of course, a profit margin and administrative fees that are higher than the traditional Medicare program.) The health insurance industry has been vigorously defending these fast-growing fee for service programs, which as I indicated is very shortsighted, since the subsidies they receive are indefensible and they threaten political support for the larger Medicare Advantage program, which hold out the real promise of bringing the benefits of managed care to the Medicare program.\n\nArlington, Va.: President Bush strongly favors industry self-regulation. It never seems to work. A corporation's profit motive isn't tempered ethics. Corporations understand two things when it comes to adhering to the law, jail and fines. While you praise Jack Valenti's ratings system, I don't think you'll find too many parents or filmakers who think it's helpful. Sure, he kept Congress out of an area they didn't want to go, but the ratings system is a joke.\n\nSteven Pearlstein: On the rating system, I think it does work in two ways. One, it has been well enforced and does give everyone -- not just parents by the way -- a sense of what they are getting into. But more important is that it has set a limit on how raunchy films can get, because the studios do anything to avoid an X rating. That sets a self-imposed limit. This has worked better with sex than with violence -- in fact, I wonder if there needs to be a violence equivalent of the X movie.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong. I'm not for self-regulation as a replacement for regulation in every case. Far from it. I'm only referring to the fact that, in their own self interest, industries should try to prevent the kind of competitive dynamic that sucks everyone into questionable practices or products that, in the long run, wind up costing the industry dearly.\n\nNew York, N.Y.: Since 2003, the GSE's purchase close to 50 percent of all subprime loans annually and bundle them as mortgage-backed securities. At the same time, they refuse to purchase many prime loans to lower income borrowers because these prime loans appear to be less profitable for their quarterly earnings ledger sheets. As tax-exempt \"Government Sponsored Enterprises\" should Fannie and Freddie do business with predatory subprime lenders and turn a blind eye to affordable prime lenders who desperately need to benefit from the liquidity and excess capital the government subsidy provides the GSE's? - Cal\n\nSteven Pearlstein: First, GSE's aren't fully tax exempt. Fannie and Freddie, anyway, are exempt from state taxation, not federal. And their bonds are not tax exempt.\n\nBut to your larger point, you are right. Fan and Fred, to different degrees, participated in packaging and marketing subprime mortgage packages to the bond market, and they weren't as effective in this area as they have been in the prime mortgage area in setting standards. Which, in a way is my point. Because Fan and Fred are the biggest and most powerful members of the MOrtgage Bankers Association, and they could have worked through that organization to set better standards and let the public know about companies that weren't meeting them.\n\nThis second point is really crucial. Its not just a matter of having standards. Most associations have them. It is a matter of really making them stick with their members and bringing pressure on those that don't. That's where the opportunity is often missed, because it is very uncomfortable doing that.\n\nBowie, Md.: The three industries you mention are all essentially financial middleman -- companies that don't do much except transfer funds, so there isn't a lot of overhead to enter the industry, or sunk-cost loss of getting out (like building a factory).\n\nUnlike the film industry, which owns lots of stuff, and in which unsucessful efforts are very expensive; isn't the problem with loans and health insurance that there just aren't many barriers to discourage unsuccessful particiaption?\n\nSteven Pearlstein: That's an interesting observation. I'm not sure where it goes, exactly, other than we expect financial intermediaries to be gatekeepers of sorts -- that's one of the reasons they deserve to get a fee -- and when they don't do this job, it can cause markets not to work in the way we expect.\n\nGreat Falls, Va.: The question about the regulators is an important one, but the real weakness in the system is the regulatory framework instituted by Congress. The subprime mortgage situation has been a perfect example. Congress has held showy hearing after hearing, trying to show constituents that they care about major issues. And at each of those hearings, the Congressmen and Senators ignore the more well-measured responses and play to the camera by feigning indignation.\n\nMeanwhile, one could point out that Congress is invariably a decade late to investigate these issues, and while they hold hearings, business interests move on to their next ventures (some of which should probably be the subject of regulation, but won't be for years to come). By the time Congress gets around to acting, it will produce a watered-down regulatory framework that half-fixes older problems that may be moot anyway.\n\nYou can't really blame Wall Street for holding Congress in disdain. They're not wrong in thinking that the legislators are too slow to respond, a bit too dim to understand the nuance of the issues, and more willing to produce sound bites than helpful regulation.\n\nWith assistance like that, how can the regulators be expected to accomplish anything?\n\nSteven Pearlstein: You know, there's no one who can be as dismissive of Congress than I, but I wonder if they are really the major culprits here. Not having any oversight hearings for six years no doubt allowed regulators to fall into the natural trap of getting too cozy with the industries they are supposed to oversee. But Congress isn't the first line of regulatory defense. I think that's asking too much of them.\n\nAn Adam Smith moment: I think what you've defined is the difference between self-interest and -enlightened- self-interest; short-term gains (splitting up the pie) vs. long-term industry health (baking a bigger pie). The movie industry was able to latch onto that longer-term view, probably because their products have a longer useful life, whereas the financial middlemen aren't interested in building a long-term customer base.\n\nSteven Pearlstein: Thanks, Mr. Smith. You said it better than I did.\n\nWashington, D.C.: Steve - Since we were never contacted for your opinion piece that indicts industry practice in the area of Medicare Advantage, I would like to ask you a simple question: At what point does your bias against a particular type of Medicare Advantage plan become a convenient route to besmirch an industry and its trade association for not doing the right thing - especially given the fact that this industry has led the way in improving the Medicare Part D program through intensive systems changes that have cost millions of dollars and also the Medicare Advantage program, which, in any form, provides better benefits for millions of beneficiaries?\n\nSteven Pearlstein: This is Mohit Ghose, from the American Heath Insurance Plans trade group, who took particular exception to my column today. I guess, Mohit, I would turn the question around: at what point does your bias in favor of fee-for-service Medicare plans, which siphon money away from other Medicare recipients, get in the way of your seeing the political damage they are causing for the more valuable private plans under Medicare Advantage? It is true I am biased against fee for service plans, because I have studied the criticism and your organization's defense of them, and find the defense very unconvincing. so did the Medicare advisory committee in its recent report, by the way. And as a columnist, I thought I was entitled to have and defend my biases.\n\nAnonymous: Steve - thanks for the response - Your column is about brokers and agent issues and the marketing of products. You can now make the issue the existence of private fee for service plans in Medicare Advantage, but that is not what your column was about. However, you indicted the industry for not remedying the issues in marketing, not for selling a product. And - people are entitled to their opinions about PFFS or MA in general, but that should not form the basis to say that the industry doesn't police itself - especially since the track record of the MA program shows that the satisfaction rates among beneficiaries are more than 80 percent across the board - precisely because of the better benefits that ALL plans provide - not just any one model - in the MA program. In fact, PFFS plans have chronic care management programs that are patient-centric, not physician centric because they have no networks. Additonally, PFFS plans and all other plans in MA are able to provide better benefits like vision, hearing and dental care which is not available in the regular FFS program. So, we believe that people should have the right information to make the most informed choice in their Medicare coverage - what we see is that people are choosing with their feet to join ALL MA products. Moreover, the industry has mechanisms in place to address the issues raised by the inappropriate marketing of all MA products, including services like call-backs to beneficiaries to confirm their choice and understanding, ride-alongs with brokers, monitoring of broker calls, and termination of contracts upon observed patterns of complaints.\n\nSteven Pearlstein: Mohit, The column wasn't just about marketing of products. It was also, in some instances, about the products themselves, such as subprime mortgages with no documentation and no money down. But I'm glad we have the opportunity here to hear/read what you have to say.\n\nBeaumont, Calif.: I agree with your concern Steve about any fee for service option under Medicare Advantage Programs. These managed care Medicare programs are why the average cost for seniors in California for medical coverage are less than most other States in the Union. They emphasize preventive care, annual physicals, shots and vaccinations, incentives for good behavior that reduce the end of life outrageous expenses, etc. I guess all of this reflects the sad state of affairs for the upcoming baby boomers in our country. The majority are way over weight, have no regular exercise programs, eat all the wrong foods, practice no preventive medicine - but they want a deal on real low cost medical insurance after the sad way in which they take care of themselves. To top it off, 75 percent of them have about $50,000 saved for their retirement. Give me a break! What has happened to personal accountability in this wonderful country of ours?\n\nSteven Pearlstein: Thanks. Didn't know that about California, which as you know, has more of a tradition of welcoming managed care than those of us in the East, where \"chosing your own doctor\" is considered to belong in the Bill of Rights!\n\nEditor's Note: washingtonpost.com moderators retain editorial control over Live Online discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions. washingtonpost.com is not responsible for any content posted by third parties.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nWashington Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein was online Wednesday, May 9 at 11 a.m. ET to discuss the growing credibility gap of Washington trade associations who are supposed to oversee and set high standards for student loans, subprime loans and Medicare plans -- all industries that are currently under scrutiny.

She tried to sleep at the entrance to the park on 60th Street, but the rats drove her onto a bench in Columbus Circle.\n\n“They were brutal,” she said of a band of six rats. “They were jumping, shrieking, making noise.”\n\nThere was wheedling. There was jostling. There was cooking, fasting and prayer. Friday was a day of endurance, nerves and hope as hundreds of thousands of people pushed themselves (and occasionally other people) just to be able to touch, or at least get close to, Pope Francis on his only full day in New York City.\n\nA Test of Patience and Community\n\nA burly man locked shoulders with his neighbor, refusing to let a woman go toward the front of the line outside Central Park even though she was claiming to be meeting her friends.\n\nNews and features on Pope Francis’ visit to Washington, New York and Philadelphia in September, his first visit ever.\n\nAnother of the faithful, Andrea Simon, warned another woman that she might lose her spot in line if she left for the bathroom. “They’re very strict.”\n\nPairs of people were trying to shove their way through the crowds, and Mary Lyons, who had come from Rochester, had had enough.\n\n“We’ve been here for an hour,” Ms. Lyons, 60, complained. “C’mon, have some respect.”\n\nHer younger brother, Roy Lyons, 54, tried to cool down the testy crowd. Carrying water, trail mix, a Kit Kat and almonds, he urged them to let go of their grievances in the spirit of Pope Francis.\n\n“This ain’t the parade,” he said. “This is a Christian event.”\n\nFinally, shortly before noon, tens of thousands of people began trickling through airport-type security stalls and into the south end of Central Park.\n\nT.S.A. agents, overseen by the Secret Service, with help from New York City police officers, rifled through bags, turned away selfie sticks and occasionally took photos to confirm that cameras were really cameras. Dogs sniffed at shoes. It was chaos sorting itself into some kind of order, as people jostling on the blocks-long line split into smaller queues, like the Midtown Tunnel at rush hour.\n\nOne brave young man squeezed through a fence to enter a less populated pen, before the crowded crew he left behind ratted him out to a police officer. He went back with his head slumped.\n\nFive Simple Meals, Elaborately Planned\n\nThe pope’s striped bass came from a Long Island fishery.\n\nHis ricotta was homemade, the ice cream on his apple crostata made with local honey.\n\nBut nothing on the table at the official residence of the apostolic nuncio of the Holy See to the United Nations, where Pope Francis will stay for two breakfasts, two dinners and one lunch this week, had quite as farm-to-table a provenance as the vegetables and herbs destined for His Holiness’s plate; these were hand-grown, -plucked and -delivered by Lidia Bastianich, of cooking show and Eataly fame.\n\nFor about 30 hours on Thursday and Friday, East 72nd Street was the scene of one of the most elaborately planned series of meals known to a city that serves hundreds of elaborately planned meals every day.\n\n“Once you have those great products, to cook them is easy,” Ms. Bastianich said. In reality, little was simple about preparing for the pontiff who cherishes simplicity. Ms. Bastianich and her business partner, Angelo Vivolo, had been refining the menu for eight months, ever since they got word that they would be reprising their roles as papal feeders-in-chief. (They also served Pope Benedict XVI two dinners when he came to New York in 2008.) Their original plans, involving “a big slab of beef,” nodded at Francis’ Argentine roots, but “that was nixed,” Ms. Bastianich said. The pope wanted light fare; his doctor had advised nothing more deluxe than white rice and fish.\n\nMs. Bastianich, an owner of the restaurants Del Posto, Felidia and Becco, does not do “white rice and fish” — not the way the doctor was imagining, at any rate. They went with a whole roasted striped bass with late-summer vegetables for his second dinner and a Piedmontese-style mushroom risotto with summer truffles for his lunch, a hat tip to the region of Francis’ Italian parents.\n\nDesserts were fruit-based: a concord grape sorbetto with angel food cake, roasted pears and grapes with almond chocolate semifreddo, the aforementioned apple crostata. Ms. Bastianich’s son, Joe Bastianich, of the restaurants Babbo and Casa Mono, poured wines from the Bastianich vineyards in Italy.\n\nMr. Vivolo and a papal aide discussed whether Francis wanted to help himself to breakfast or be served, and whether he preferred to eat family style.\n\nThe only specific papal request was small: bananas and still water for his room. So Ms. Bastianich stocked the bedroom with two kinds of bananas, large and small.\n\nShe could not resist sneaking in some biscuits, too. “Just in case,” she said.\n\nA Granddaughter Carries On a Legacy\n\nMartha Hennessy, 60, was not watching on Thursday when Pope Francis, in his speech to Congress, invoked her grandmother, Dorothy Day, as one of four Americans who, through “hard work and self-sacrifice,” had made this country better.\n\nInstead, Ms. Hennessy was taking part in a vigil in New York, across the street from the United Nations, in solidarity with the pope’s messages about caring for the poor and vulnerable and saving the earth from climate change.\n\n“They’re just a good fit, the two of them,” she said of her grandmother, who died in 1980, and Francis.\n\nMs. Day was a journalist who spent her youth among literary circles in Greenwich Village before converting to Catholicism. She started the Catholic Worker newspaper in 1933 to address issues of poverty and social justice and founded many homes for the poor and homeless. Today, there are more than 200 Catholic Worker communities around the world, inspired by Ms. Day and dedicated to serving the poor.\n\nMs. Hennessy is the seventh of nine children born to Ms. Day’s only child, Tamar Hennessy.\n\nThe pope made public appearances and shared private moments among the people and the powerful in Washington.\n\nMartha Hennessy is a retired occupational therapist, and for the past five years has been a part-time volunteer and resident at Maryhouse, a settlement home for women on East Third Street that Ms. Day founded and where she spent her final years.\n\nMs. Hennessy said that she was not entirely surprised that the pope had mentioned her grandmother, since she knew that Cardinal Timothy M.

After the speech, she broke her fast with soup at St. Joseph House, Maryhouse’s counterpart for men on First Street.

Maybe God has a bigger plan for us.”\n\nMs. Da Silva headed to Central Park, although the faithful were overflowing there, too. Outside, she stopped a nun to ask if she might have an extra ticket.\n\nAnd then, two more tickets appeared. “Can you believe it?” Ms. Da Silva said joyfully by phone.\n\nShe said later that she had a great view. “He was so close. It was amazing!” Ms. Da Silva exclaimed in a phone interview. She sent a text message, too: “I’m crying soooo much right now!!!”\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated how long before Pope Francis arrived at Central Park it was that the line at one gate there stretched for two and a half blocks.

The extraordinary worldwide attention paid to the death of Gabriel García Márquez, and the genuine sorrow felt by readers everywhere at his passing, tells us that the books are still very much alive. Somewhere a dictatorial “patriarch” is still having his rival cooked and served up to his dinner guests on a great dish; an old colonel is waiting for a letter that never comes; a beautiful young girl is being prostituted by her heartless grandmother; and a kindlier patriarch, José Arcadio Buendía, one of the founders of the new settlement of Macondo, a man interested in science and alchemy, is declaring to his horrified wife that “the earth is round, like an orange.”\n\nWe live in an age of invented, alternate worlds. Tolkien’s Middle-earth, Rowling’s Hogwarts, the dystopic universe of “The Hunger Games,” the places where vampires and zombies prowl: These places are having their day. Yet in spite of the vogue for fantasy fiction, in the finest of literature’s fictional microcosms there is more truth than fantasy. In William Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha, R. K. Narayan’s Malgudi and, yes, the Macondo of Gabriel García Márquez, imagination is used to enrich reality, not to escape from it.\n\n“One Hundred Years of Solitude” is 47 years old now, and despite its colossal and enduring popularity, its style — magic realism — has largely given way, in Latin America, to other forms of narration, in part as a reaction against the sheer size of García Márquez’s achievement. The most highly regarded writer of the next generation, Roberto Bolaño, notoriously declared that magic realism “stinks,” and jeered at García Márquez’s fame, calling him “a man terribly pleased to have hobnobbed with so many presidents and archbishops.” It was a childish outburst, but it showed that for many Latin American writers the presence of the great colossus in their midst was more than a little burdensome. (“I have the feeling,” Carlos Fuentes once said to me, “that writers in Latin America can’t use the word ‘solitude’ any more, because they worry that people will think it’s a reference to Gabo. And I’m afraid,” he added, mischievously, “that soon we will not be able to use the phrase ‘100 years’ either.”) No writer in the world has had a comparable impact in the last half-century. Ian McEwan has accurately compared his pre-eminence to that of Charles Dickens. No writer since Dickens was so widely read, and so deeply loved, as Gabriel García Márquez.\n\nThe great man’s passing may put an end to Latin American writers’ anxiety at his influence, and allow his work to be noncompetitively appreciated. Fuentes, acknowledging García Márquez’s debt to Faulkner, called Macondo his Yoknapatawpha County, and that may be a better point of entry into the oeuvre. These are stories about real people, not fairy tales. Macondo exists; that is its magic.\n\nThe trouble with the term “magic realism,” el realismo mágico, is that when people say or hear it they are really hearing or saying only half of it, “magic,” without paying attention to the other half, “realism.” But if magic realism were just magic, it wouldn’t matter. It would be mere whimsy — writing in which, because anything can happen, nothing has effect. It’s because the magic in magic realism has deep roots in the real, because it grows out of the real and illuminates it in beautiful and unexpected ways, that it works. Consider this famous passage from “One Hundred Years of Solitude”:\n\n“As soon as José Arcadio closed the bedroom door the sound of a pistol shot echoed through the house. A trickle of blood came out under the door, crossed the living room, went out into the street, continued on in a straight line across the uneven terraces, went down steps and climbed over curbs, passed along the Street of the Turks, turned a corner to the right and another to the left, made a right angle at the Buendía house, went in under the closed door, crossed through the parlor, hugging the walls so as not to stain the rugs . . . and came out in the kitchen, where Úrsula was getting ready to crack 36 eggs to make bread.\n\n“ ‘Holy Mother of God!’ Úrsula shouted.”\n\nSomething utterly fantastic is happening here. A dead man’s blood acquires a purpose, almost a life of its own, and moves methodically through the streets of Macondo until it comes to rest at his mother’s feet. The blood’s behavior is “impossible,” yet the passage reads as truthful, the journey of the blood like the journey of the news of his death from the room where he shot himself to his mother’s kitchen, and its arrival at the feet of the matriarch Úrsula Iguarán reads as high tragedy: A mother learns that her son is dead. José Arcadio’s lifeblood can and must go on living until it can bring Úrsula the sad news. The real, by the addition of the magical, actually gains in dramatic and emotional force. It becomes more real, not less.\n\nMagic realism was not García Márquez’s invention. The Brazilian Machado de Assis, the Argentine Jorge Luis Borges and the Mexican Juan Rulfo came before him. García Márquez studied Rulfo’s masterpiece “Pedro Páramo” closely, and likened its impact on him to that of Kafka’s “Metamorphosis.” (In the novel’s ghost town of Comala it’s easy to see the birthplace of García Márquez’s Macondo.) But the magic-realist sensibility is not limited to Latin America. It crops up in all of the world’s literatures from time to time, and García Márquez was famously well read.\n\nDickens’s unending court case, Jarndyce v. Jarndyce in “Bleak House,” finds a relative in “One Hundred Years of Solitude” in the unending railway train that passes by Macondo for a week. Dickens and García Márquez are both masters of comic hyperbole. Dickens’s Circumlocution Office, a government department that exists to do nothing, inhabits the same fictional reality as all the indolent, corrupt, authoritarian governors and tyrants in García Márquez’s work.\n\nKafka’s Gregor Samsa, metamorphosed into a large insect, would not feel out of place in Macondo, where metamorphoses are treated as commonplace. Gogol’s Kovalyov, whose nose detaches itself from his face and wanders around St. Petersburg, would also feel at home. The French Surrealists and the American fabulists are also of this literary company, inspired by the idea of the fictionality of fiction, its made-up-ness, an idea that unshackles literature from the confines of the naturalistic and allows it to approach the truth by wilder, and perhaps more interesting, routes. García Márquez knew very well that he belonged to a far-flung literary family. William Kennedy quotes him saying, “In Mexico, surrealism runs through the streets.” And then: “The Latin American reality is totally Rabelaisian.”\n\nBut, to say it again: The flights of fancy need real ground beneath them. When I first read García Márquez I had never been to any Central or South American country. Yet in his pages I found a reality I knew well from my own experience in India and Pakistan. In both places there was and is a conflict between the city and the village, and there are similarly profound gulfs between rich and poor, powerful and powerless, the great and the small. Both are places with a strong colonial history, and in both places religion is of great importance and God is alive, and so, unfortunately, are the godly.\n\nI knew García Márquez’s colonels and generals, or at least their Indian and Pakistani counterparts; his bishops were my mullahs; his market streets were my bazaars. His world was mine, translated into Spanish. It’s little wonder I fell in love with it — not for its magic (although, as a writer reared on the fabulous “wonder tales” of the East, that was appealing too) but for its realism. My world was more urban than his, however. It is the village sensibility that gives García Márquez’s realism its particular flavor, the village in which technology is frightening but a devout girl rising up to heaven is perfectly credible; in which, as in Indian villages, the miraculous is everywhere believed to coexist with the quotidian.\n\nHe was a journalist who never lost sight of the facts. He was a dreamer who believed in the truth of dreams. He was also a writer capable of moments of delirious, and often comic, beauty. At the beginning of “Love in the Time of Cholera”: “The scent of bitter almonds always reminded him of the fate of unrequited love.” At the heart of “The Autumn of the Patriarch,” after the dictator sells the Caribbean to the Americans, the American ambassador’s nautical engineers “carried it off in numbered pieces to plant it far from the hurricanes in the blood-red dawns of Arizona, they took it away with everything it had inside general sir, with the reflection of our cities, our timid drowned people, our demented dragons.” The first railway train arrives in Macondo and a woman goes mad with fear. “It’s coming,” she cries. “Something frightful, like a kitchen dragging a village behind it.” And of course, unforgettably:\n\n“Colonel Aureliano Buendía organized 32 armed uprisings and he lost them all. He had 17 male children by 17 different women and they were exterminated one after the other on a single night before the oldest one had reached the age of 35. He survived 14 attempts on his life, 73 ambushes and a firing squad. He lived through a dose of strychnine in his coffee that was enough to kill a horse.”\n\nFor such magnificence, our only possible reaction is gratitude. He was the greatest of us all.\n\nSalman Rushdie is the author of 11 novels and, most recently, the autobiographical memoir “Joseph Anton.”\n\nA version of this article appears in print on May 18, 2014, on page BR1 of the Sunday Book Review with the headline: Magic in Service of Truth.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00014-of-00064--292", "original_text": "America’s first step in its attempt to reconquer worlds beyond our planet ended in spectacular success on Friday. An unmanned version of its Orion spacecraft soared more than 3,000 miles into space before splashing down on target in the Pacific ocean. The flight was hailed by Nasa, which says that the spaceship is destined to be the first of a fleet that will carry humans to the Moon, Mars and beyond.\n\nIn many laboratories and research centres, this delight was shared by scientists. A return to sending men and women to other parts of the solar system – years after the US scrapped its last manned space vehicle, the shuttle – cannot come soon enough for them.\n\nBut for others, the test flight was viewed as a distinctly unhappy event. Putting humans into space is futile, expensive and ultimately harmful to real science, argue researchers who believe that robot craft represent the future of space exploration and are dismayed by the US’s commitment to return to expensive manned missions.\n\n“For a while I thought president Obama was going to see sense and would wean America off its fascination with putting men and women into space by scrapping manned missions,” the Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg told the Observer. “Unfortunately, with the flight of Orion, that hope has now been dashed.”\n\nScientists like Weinberg point to missions such as Europe’s Rosetta and Philae probes which have successfully begun an exploration of Comet 67P. They argue that these missions represent the real future of the solar system’s exploration. Men and women will remain expensive nuisances when it comes to discovering other worlds, they say. Relatively cheap robot probes are the future.\n\nThe existence of these two camps – manned versus unmanned – reveal a deep division in attitude to space exploration. On one hand, enthusiasts such as astronomer Professor Ian Crawford of Birkbeck College, London, believe that, although modern robots are capable of highly sophisticated tasks, only humans can carry out some forms of exploration.\n\n“We learned a great deal from the Apollo missions, but their landings were all confined to sites near the lunar equator on one side of the Moon,” he said. “The samples they returned to Earth were made up of rocks found lying around the surface. But on the far side of the Moon, there is a region where meteorite impacts have excavated material from deep below the lunar surface. If we could explore these regions and bring samples back to Earth, we will transform our understanding of how the Earth and its satellite, the Moon, formed in the distant past.”\n\nCrawford envisages setting up a handful of lunar colonies that would mirror the establishment of research bases in the Antarctic. From these, small numbers of astronauts would survey the lunar landscape, make observations and collect samples.\n\n“These missions would use robot vehicles as assistants but would depend on human intuition and leadership,” he said. “Humans and robots would work together.” And after the Moon, targets such as Mars and possibly the asteroids would be explored in a similar manner, he added.\n\nThis vision is not shared by all scientists. Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal, believes the cost of putting humans in space is harder to justify because of the rising sophistication of robots. “If you look at the great discoveries that have already been made in the solar system’s exploration, the vast majority have been carried out by robot probes: the discovery of the great hydrocarbon lakes on Saturn’s moon, Titan, and the discovery of the underground ocean on another of its moons, Enceladus, are good examples,” he said.\n\nRees stresses that human spaceflight could still be pursued, without damage to science, if it was left to entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk, whose SpaceX rockets are now used to carry cargo to the space station: “However, I think the future of planetary exploration will continue to be dominated by robot probes which will be spread throughout the solar system. You can imagine robot fabricators mining the asteroids and building large structures in space or on the Moon.”\n\nFrom this perspective, relying on humans to carry out scientific exploration in space is unjustified, a point emphasised by Weinberg, who describes the International Space Station – claimed by Nasa to be an orbiting multidisciplinary laboratory – as “an orbital turkey”.\n\nNo important science has ever emerged from it with the exception of one cosmic ray experiment which could easily have been done on an unmanned satellite, he believes. Indeed, he adds, the whole manned spaceflight programme, which is so enormously expensive, has produced very little of scientific value.\n\nManned space flight crowds out real science, Weinberg argues. As an example, he points out that in 2004, president George W Bush announced a new vision of manned space missions for Nasa in which the agency would return to the Moon then head on to Mars. A few days later, Nasa revealed it was making major cutbacks in its programmes of unmanned research in astronomy because they “do not clearly support the goals of the president’s vision for space exploration”. In other words, to support manned missions science projects were cut back.\n\nEven worse, says Weinberg, was the example of the US Superconducting Super-Collider, which was designed to study the structure of matter by crashing sub-atomic particles into each other at colossal energies. Its $12bn construction, in Texas, was cancelled in 1993 because Congress decided the US could not build the SSC and the International Space Station, of which the US was the main supporter of funds, at the same time. So it chose to build the space station, mainly for political reasons.\n\nThis left Europe free to build its own Large Hadron Collider, at Cern, Geneva, a decade later, where scientists discovered the Higgs Boson in 2013 and are set to begin the search for dark matter and other exotic particles when the LHC reopens next year after a refit.\n\nBy contrast, the US ended up with that “orbital turkey”, a decision described by Weinberg as a tragic mistake. “The only real technology that the space station has produced concerns the technology of keeping humans alive in space – which is a senseless and circular process if you realise there is no point in having humans in space,” he said.\n\nSo are science and manned spaceflight virtually incompatible? No, says Crawford. For a start, the idea of robot efficiency is a myth, he says, as there is no substitute for putting a person into space to get things done. “Just consider Philae,” he said. “It did bounce when it landed on comet 67P and in the end only carried out a couple of days’ work – albeit very, very important work – before it stopped working. By contrast, if we had had a bigger mission, with humans on board, the pilot would have been able to land it expertly on that tricky terrain.\n\n“There would have been no bouncing. Instrument packages would then have been left on the surface while samples of rock, soil and ice from the comet would have been brought back to Earth so they could be studied in detail and at leisure in laboratories. That’s what you get with a manned mission.”\n\nThe difference in scientific return rates from manned and unmanned missions is vividly illustrated by the Apollo 17 mission, flown by astronauts Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt in 1972, and the robot rover Opportunity which, in 2004, was dropped on to the surface of Mars and has been exploring ever since, said Crawford. “Apollo 17 spent three days on the Moon while its astronauts made journeys across the lunar surface that totalled 31 kilometres,” he said. “They also drilled a three-metre hole into the surface, the deepest made in an object outside Earth, left a range of instrument packages behind them, and then brought back a 76kg of rock back to Earth.\n\n“Opportunity took 10 years before it managed to run up a travel total of 31km. More to the point, it returned no samples of any kind, did no drilling and returned only limited data.”\n\nThe contrast between the scientific returns of the two approaches is revealed by examining the number of scientific papers based on the Apollo missions, says Crawford. These vastly outnumber the papers produced from all the robot missions that have been carried out on the Moon and Mars. And the number of publications based on Apollo sample is still rising. “Its scientific legacy has been far greater than any other mission we have made to another world,” said Crawford.\n\nIt was a legacy that was bought at a considerable price, however. The Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s cost $25bn –more than $100bn today. From this perspective, manned missions are more than 100 times more expensive than robot missions, it is calculated. In the early days of spaceflight, there was little alternative to putting humans in spacecraft. But now robotics has achieved an advanced status and is constantly becoming more sophisticated. Martian rovers can navigate rocky terrains, drill holes and analyse soil samples – using 20th-century technology.\n\n“Just consider the Rosetta mission,” argues Rees. “It was designed using 1990s technology – when mobile phones were the size of bricks. Now they are compact and contain a wide array of different functions. Imagine what Rosetta would have been able to do if it had been built from that technology. Imagine what future robot spacecraft will be able to do.”\n\nSupporters of manned spaceflight, such as Professor Martin Barstow, of Leicester University, accept human flights are much more expensive but say they are justifiable because they are much, much more effective than robot missions: “Consider Mars. You could get robots to scrape its surface and send back material to Earth, but if you want to hunt down the few places that might still support primitive life you will need to send humans. Only they possess the necessary intuition for that kind of task.”\n\nOthers point to the inspirational effects of putting men in space. In the 1960s astronauts such as Yuri Gagarin and Neil Armstrong stimulated youngsters into careers in science because manned flights create heroes who spark an interest in technology. But again this claim is disputed. If a classroom today displays space photographs, these are more likely to be glorious images of stars and galaxies taken by the Hubble space telescope than pictures of astronauts. “It’s the robot probe that captures interest today,” said Rees. “The only time an astronaut makes news is when a space station toilet gets blocked.”\n\nIn short, the jury is still out over the future of humans in space. However, one thing is clear: we may one day return to other worlds, like the Moon and maybe Mars, but current global economic problems suggest these trips will happen later rather than sooner.\n\nYuri Gagarin became the first human to fly in space when he orbited the Earth in his Vostok spacecraft on 12 April 1961. His mission was followed by a series of flights - by the US and the Soviet Union - of larger and larger capsules. These culminated in the lunar landings of the US Apollo programme in the late 60s and early 70s.\n\nThe 12 men who landed on the Moon on Apollo spacecraft are the only humans to have walked on another world.\n\nAfter the Apollo programme was brought to a premature close, largely due to lack of public interest in the US, America concentrated its efforts on constructing a fleet of reusable space shuttles. These were intended to become the nation’s primary means of launching payloads into orbit and were to be launched once a week when fully operational according to Nasa’s ambitious timetable. The first shuttle, Columbia, was launched on 12 April 1981.\n\nThirty years later the fleet was retired after a total of only 135 flights - including two catastrophic accidents which destroyed the shuttles Challenger and Columbia and killed each of their seven-person crews.\n\nSince then, the only craft capable of carrying astronauts to the International Space Station has been Russia’s Soyuz space capsule.\n\nAt the same time the Chinese have pursued their own manned spaceflight programme, which began in 2003, when Yang Liwei became the first person sent into space by the Chinese space programme after orbiting the Earth 14 times in his Shenzhou 5 capsule, making China the third country to independently send humans into space.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nAmerica’s first step in its attempt to reconquer worlds beyond our planet ended in spectacular success on Friday.

{"id": "newsr-gemma-2b-continue-0.0-00004-of-00064--1045", "original_text": "For two days in early June every year, China comes to a standstill as high school students who are about to graduate take their college entrance exams. Literally the “higher examination”, the gaokao is a national event on a par with a public holiday, but much less fun. Construction work is halted near examination halls, so as not to disturb the students, and traffic is diverted. Ambulances are on call outside in case of nervous collapses, and police cars patrol to keep the streets quiet. Radio talkshow hosts discuss the format and questions in painstaking detail, and when the results come out, the top scorers are feted nationally. A high or low mark determines life opportunities and earning potential. That score is the most important number of any Chinese child’s life, the culmination of years of schooling, memorisation and constant stress.\n\nOn 8 June, the final afternoon of this year’s gaokao, parents of exam takers at one school in Beijing were packed tight around the school gate, jostling to get to the front of the crowd where a white metal barrier held them back. Special security guards handed out water bottles and cheap paper fans, while another manned a first aid stand under a large parasol. Cars were parked all the way around the bend of the road leading to the gate, simmering in the summer heat. “They’re all here to pick up their kids,” a city police officer patiently explained to a driver struggling to find a space. A red banner above the barrier declared the school a “National unified gaokao examination point”. At the first sign of movement inside, the parents pushed in closer, craning their necks to spot their children emerging.\n\nShortly after 5pm, a student named Yuan Qi walked out clutching a clear pencil case and wearing a dazed expression. Around him, hundreds of exam-takers celebrated the end of their ordeal. Some clutched bouquets of flowers given to them by their parents; others posed awkwardly for photographs. Yuan Qi’s father, an administrator in the People’s Liberation Army, was dressed in shorts and a polo neck. He had been at the front of the crowd, holding his phone up high to record the moment. But when his son came out, he greeted him silently and led him away from the hubbub to where his mother was waiting. She took his pencil case to stop him fidgeting with it. “Hard?” another parent asked Yuan Qi as they passed. “Depends which subject,” he replied. His father beamed with pride.\n\nYuan Qi is 18, thin and wiry, with blue half-rim spectacles, close-cropped hair and budding wisps on his upper lip. A student at Beijing 101 school, one of the capital’s most prestigious boarding schools, he is the nervous sort – constantly fiddling with stationery or picking at his fingers. He has a habit of rushing to the end of his sentences, slurring his words when excited, as if frustrated that telepathy is not an option. Ever since he was a young boy, growing up in Hebei, the province surrounding Beijing, Yuan Qi has had a talent for maths, science and problem solving. He loves reading murder mysteries, especially Agatha Christie novels in Chinese translation, which is how he came up with his English name – Hercule – although his moustache is yet to live up to it.\n\nMembership Event: The Long Read live at the Hospital Club\n\nThe first time a teacher of his mentioned the gaokao, Yuan Qi was in primary school. Used as a distant incentive for working hard, the word kept cropping up in school and at the dinner table until it dawned on him just how high the stakes were. While college entrance is competitive in any country, in China the top universities can select as few as one in 50,000 students. Competition is intense for white-collar jobs, with a graduate unemployment rate of about 16%, and which college a student goes to has an immediate impact on career and even marriage prospects. That placement is decided by a single factor: their three-digit gaokao score.\n\nSpy cameras, radios and earpieces that transmit questions and answers have been found hidden in pens and underwear\n\nWith so much to gain or lose, cheating is a big problem. Spy cameras, radio devices and earpieces that transmit questions and receive answers have been found hidden in jewellery, spectacles, wallets, pens, rulers and underwear. Most examination rooms install CCTV cameras, and some use metal detectors. Last year, police busted a syndicate in Jiangxi province, where professional exam-takers were charging parents up to a million yuan (£121,300) to pose as students. In Luoyang, a city in Henan province, examiners deployed a drone to hover above school buildings and scan for radio signals sent in or out. Fingerprint and iris-matching has been used to verify the identity of students. Exam papers are escorted to schools by security guards and monitored with GPS trackers, while the examiners who draft them are kept under close scrutiny in order to avoid leaks. This year, new regulations came into effect that could sentence cheats to up to seven years in prison.\n\nYuan Qi was quietly confident. In his mocks he was averaging in the 690s, out of a maximum of 750 – good enough to get into the capital’s elite universities. He had been cramming for 12 hours a day in the months leading up to the test, with extra classes at weekends. Since March, he had been operating on just six or seven hours sleep a night. Every possible step had been taken to maximise his chances of succeeding. The day before the first morning paper, his parents had rented a hotel room next to Tsinghua University middle school, where he would sit his papers, so that they could arrange his meals and attend to his every other need. By that point, Yuan Qi had spent so much time doing mock exams that he was totally inured to the real thing, which passed in a haze.\n\n“It went about usual,” he told me as we walked back to his hotel, massaging his wrist. “Nothing out of the ordinary. Now I just want to go home and play some games.” Yuan Qi’s father was still recording videos of him, still grinning. “The exam is very nerve-racking, and each time when I was standing outside, before it began, I was terrified. But when you’re actually taking it it’s not so bad.” Now that the struggle was over, there was nothing he could do but wait for the result.\n\nThe gaokao is emblematic of the Chinese education system as a whole. In the west, it is often seen as monolithic and rote; in China as tough but fair. In Europe and America, there is the notion that Chinese schools produce automatons incapable of critical thought; in China, many seem to think that western classrooms are full of students standing on desks and ripping up textbooks, à la Dead Poets Society. Yet, where the Chinese model used to be roundly criticised for rewarding rote learning, now the system’s gruelling schedule and supposed high standards are increasingly admired overseas. Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist, has praised Shanghai’s school system with at times absurd hyperbole. (One column was fawningly titled “The Shanghai Secret”.) Last year, the BBC invited two Chinese teachers to take over a sixth-form class in the documentary Are Our Kids Tough Enough? (Spoiler: they weren’t, but nor were the teachers.)\n\nIn China there are no illusions about the system being perfect. The exam is widely criticised for putting impossible pressures on children. Dissatisfaction with the gaokao is one reason that, among wealthier segments of the population, large numbers of students are choosing to study abroad. But, ultimately, most people support it, or at least see no alternative. “China has too many people,” is a common refrain, used to excuse everything from urban traffic to rural poverty. Given the intense competition for finite higher education resources, the argument goes, there has to be some way to separate the wheat from the chaff, and to give hardworking students from poorer backgrounds a chance to rise to the top.\n\nThe tradition of a single exam that decides a young person’s prospects is one that goes back to antiquity in China. The imperial examinations or keju, which tested applicants for government office, was introduced in the Han dynasty (206BC to AD220), and became the sole criterion for selection from the 7th century until its abolition in 1905. Aspiring bureaucrats sat a three-day exam locked inside a single cell, in which they also slept and ate. The “eight-legged essay” was the most important paper, an argument in eight sections that elaborated on a theme while quoting from classics such as Confucius and Mencius. All applicants were checked for hidden scrolls; writing quotes on underwear was a popular form of cheating until examiners cottoned on. The pass rate was 1%. Nervous collapses were routine. There is even a ghost-deity associated with exams in China: Zhong Kui, a scholar who killed himself when he was denied first place.\n\nWhile not a direct descendant, the gaokao is generally considered a distant relation of the keju. First instituted in 1952 under the new Communist government, the gaokao was suspended during the cultural revolution. Most universities were closed, and remaining college places were assigned according to political background rather than academic ability. It was only in 1977, the year after Mao’s death, that the gaokao resumed in its modern form. The first sitting was open to generations who had been deprived of the chance to pursue higher education – 5.7 million people enrolled, competing for just 220,000 university seats. Since 1978, it has been held every summer.\n\nThe gaokao is made up of four three-hour papers: Chinese, English, maths and a choice of either sciences (biology, chemistry, physics) or humanities (geography, history, politics). The questions are mostly multiple-choice or fill-in-the-gap, and are notoriously hard – the maths paper has been compared to university-level maths in the UK. But for many students, the most intimidating element is the essay in the Chinese exam. Students are given an hour to write on one of two prompts, which are often infuriatingly elliptical. Prompts in 2015 included “Do butterfly wings have colours?” and “Who do you admire the most? A biotechnology researcher, a welding engineering technician or a photographer?”. This summer, Yuan Qi’s choice was between “Old accent” and “Mysterious bookmark”. (He picked old accent.)\n\nIt is no surprise that, for many students, the pressure heaped on them by parents, teachers and themselves, is overwhelming. It is possible to retake the exam one year later, but if a student continues to fail there is no safety net or alternative path to university. Suicides are a regular feature of every exam season; a 2014 study claimed that exam stress was a contributing factor in 93% of cases in which school students took their own lives. Last year, a middle school in Hebei province fenced off its upper-floor dormitory balconies with grates, after two students jumped to their deaths in the months leading up to the gaokao. And the academic stress starts early – in July a 10-year-old boy tried to kill himself in oncoming traffic after fighting with his mother about homework. But still the study mill grinds on.\n\nIn April, two months before the exam, the campus of Yuan Qi’s school was deceptively tranquil. A tree-lined boulevard led up to Beijing 101’s front entrance, where two guards with truncheons watched over the security gate. Inside, the school buildings glistened in the sun, surrounded by spacious sports grounds and a lake with a goose house and lotus flowers. Students walked around in colour-coded slacks that, like all school uniforms in China, more closely resembled pyjamas: dark blue for year 11, mauve and white for year 12, purple for year 13. The school nestles into the west flank of Beijing’s old Summer Palace – once the relaxation grounds of Qing dynasty emperors – and a back gate connects directly to the garden ruins. Founded in 1946, Beijing 101 was initially set up to educate the children of China’s top officials, and it still has many such students among its ranks.\n\nIt was an accomplishment for Yuan Qi to even be there. At his local primary school in Hebei province, there had been 70 to 80 children in each class. The school’s football pitch was never used, as none of the teachers knew the rules. Yuan Qi’s residency papers, or hukou, dictated that he should have stayed in Hebei for middle school, but his father used his connections in the People’s Liberation Army and arranged a transfer to Beijing, with a new hukou. Once there, Yuan Qi enrolled in a better middle school and, thanks to a good performance in the zhongkao – the entrance exam for high school – got into Beijing 101 at the age of 16. Yuan Qi was now one step closer to securing his future at the college he dreamed of attending.\n\nJust a hundred metres down the road from Beijing 101, in the heart of the city’s university district, lies Peking University (or Beida, as it’s known in China). With its illustrious history, roll call of famous alumni and romantic campus dotted with lakes and stone bridges, Beida is the Chinese equivalent of Oxford or Cambridge. Ever since his parents first told him about it as a child, Yuan Qi had always dreamed of going there to study maths. His parents and teachers were encouraging, but even their expectations, he told me, were nothing like the pressure he put on himself.\n\n“In middle school I realised that primary school was easy,” he said. “And in high school I realised that middle school was easy.” At Beijing 101, classes had just 20 to 30 students, but the work was twice as intensive as before. As Yuan Qi’s grades were good, he was put into one of four “experimental classes” in his year, which went at an even faster pace. And on top of his regular subjects, like all Chinese students, he also took two hours of politics class each week. They included the compulsory modules of Mao Zedong thought and Deng Xiaoping economic theory, which were introduced in 1991 as part of a patriotic education campaign. I ordered online one of the politics textbooks that Yuan Qi would be studying from. It was titled Integrity of Thought, and a typical page featured a cartoon of three boys sitting around a table discussing the latest government initiatives (as one does), with an accompanying discussion question for students: “What are the everyday applications of these laws?”\n\nThe routine at Beijing 101 is punishing. At 6.30am Yuan Qi was out of his dorm bed, and he was in the canteen for breakfast by 6.50. At 7.20 came half an hour of self-study reading time. From 8am he had five 40-minute classes, broken by a half an hour of group calisthenics in the yard – a thousand students doing jumping jacks in unison – or running around the grounds. Another three afternoon classes were interrupted by five minutes of eye exercises, during which students massaged their tired brows while a recorded track told them to rub behind their ears and press their temples. School broke at 4.05pm, but there was still another three or four hours of homework to be completed before bed.\n\nAs summer arrived, the pace picked up for Yuan Qi and his classmates. Almost all classes were now spent looking at past gaokao papers in methodical detail. After school, there were two extra hours of mock exams every day, on top of the homework, and five additional classes on Saturday. On Sundays, Yuan Qi’s parents had arranged private tuition for him in English and Chinese. His only relaxation was playing computer games, but whereas in middle school he had enjoyed complex online roleplayers, now he only had time for smartphone apps.\n\nWhen I visited Beijing 101, the scene was not as disciplined as I had expected. School pupils in China are kids, after all, not robots – they goof around, joke, talk over each other. At the front gate as I waited to be let in, three boys were lifting up a fourth, giving him a wedgie. Inside was a bulletin board listing extra-curricular activities, from drama to traditional crosstalk comedy performances. A corrugated steel fence next to a basketball court was covered in graffiti, albeit sanctioned by the teachers and expletive-free: V for Vendetta; an alien face with the words “Once I was normal”; “Big Brother is Watching You”, with one of the letters replaced with a swastika. But in class the students quietened down, listened carefully and took notes. In years of reporting in China, I have never heard a single student grumble about their workload. To them, it is simply normal.\n\nI sat in on one of Yuan Qi’s maths classes while the teacher – a tough but kindly woman with a strong Beijing accent – walked through exam-paper equations that left me feeling like a dunce. Yuan Qi followed along at his white plastic desk, where sheets covered in intricate geometrical squiggles were sprawled out next to his pencil case and a roll of toilet paper for blowing his nose. At the back of the classroom, a cartoon of Xi Jinping was drawn in coloured chalk on the blackboard next to the words “Wishing you a successful exam” and a reminder: “46 days”. This countdown is a national obsession. If you search for “gaokao” on Baidu, China’s largest search engine, in the months leading up to the exam, an image appears at the top of the results page, with a clock counting down to the start of the exam, next to a cartoon of a schoolgirl riding a flying book.\n\nBefore Yuan Qi knew it, the countdown was at 30 days. 15. Ten. Five. With just three days left, on 4 June – while the rest of Beijing either forgot or ignored the 27th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre – Beijing 101 held a big pre-exam event in the main lecture hall: part pep talk, part rules refresher. Yuan Qi and his friends joked among themselves, half-listening while the headteacher went through the exam drill in excruciating detail, from how students should register with their IDs to what to do if they needed extra paper. At the end, all the teachers lined up and waved at their pupils from under a PowerPoint slide that read: “We have already done abundant preparation! Wishing you every success! Awaiting the good news!”\n\nWith that, 12 years of primary and secondary education were finished. The climax of it all was in sight. Yuan Qi went home, and got his head straight for the first paper.\n\nIn China, the gaokao is sometimes described as a dumuqiao, which translates as “single-log bridge” – a difficult path that everyone has to walk. But some have better shoes than others. Rich families lay on extra tutoring for their children in what Jiang Xueqin, a Canadian-Chinese education scholar, described as an “arms race” among households looking to increase their child’s chances. Provinces with larger populations have tougher standards of entry into the best universities, while those that are sparsely populated set a lower bar. (This loophole has led to illegal “gaokao migrants” transferring to schools in Inner Mongolia just before the exam.) Students in Beijing and Shanghai get special privileges – they are the beneficiaries of generous local quotas for the best universities – despite being more likely to be privileged anyway.\n\n“Scores are highly correlated with socioeconomic status,” Trey Menefee, a lecturer at the Hong Kong Institute of Education, told me. I asked if he considered the exam meritocratic. “I don’t,” he replied, “but almost every Chinese person does … Or it’s meritocratic only because it’s equally bad for everyone.”\n\nThere has been talk of reforming the gaokao for as long as it has existed, but little ever comes of it. The major concession in the early 2000s was to allow separate provinces to draft their own exam papers. This year, top universities trialled interviews with students who show special promise at school. Those who impress may be awarded extra points, which are added to their final exam score. Many students and their families have also called for the English paper – a stumbling block for many without access to private tuition – to be made optional.\n\nMeanwhile, relatively small changes can meet fierce resistance. In May, the government announced that a quota of 80,000 university places in Jiangsu and Hubei provinces would be reserved for students from poorer regions, in an effort to address provincial inequality. But mobs of middle-class parents took to the streets in six cities to protest against the measures, fearful that positive discrimination in favour of poorer families meant their own children would lose out. “The gaokao isn’t for everyone,” Jiang Xueqin told me. “It’s for the middle class.”\n\nWhen it comes to more comprehensive reform, the general consensus among education scholars in China is that any alternative would be too easily manipulated by the rich. Were coursework or regular school marks to be taken into account alongside exam grades, bribery would be even more rampant than it already is (parents often give “red packages” stuffed with banknotes to teachers in return for special attention for their child in class, or simply a seat nearer the front). The same goes for direct university admission. And so, futures are still decided by how well each child performs at a cramped desk in a closed room for two days in early June.\n\nNot every student in China signs off their fate to the gaokao. Although more than nine million people still take it every year, the number is declining. This is partly down to the rising popularity of vocational courses, which often offer better prospects of finding a job after graduation, especially for those whose grades are less competitive. Above all, more and more students are heading abroad for university, and increasingly for high school. It used to be that the best students went to Beida; now they go to Harvard. There are more than 300,000 Chinese overseas students in US higher education and 90,000 in the UK. While many colleges overseas recognise the gaokao, it isn’t necessary to take it to secure a place. Just as China’s moneyed classes are deciding to protect their wealth by placing it overseas, their children are opting out of the country’s education system on an industrial scale.\n\nOne of Yuan Qi’s classmates in the experimental class at Beijing 101, Jiang Xinye, joined the exodus. During her last year of school, by arrangement with her teachers, she stopped coming to class and instead prepared applications to US colleges. Her parents hired the services of Bridge International Education, a company that helps students select colleges and pull application materials together (the bill was roughly £8,000; other companies charge up to £20,000). Instead of the gaokao she took the TOEFL, an English proficiency exam, and her SAT, the US college-entrance aptitude test. She settled on a major in business, and wrote in her personal statement about her experience selling phone cases at school. With the help of a college counsellor she filled in forms for 12 universities. When it was all over she accepted a place at Brandeis, a private university in Massachusetts.\n\nJiang Xinye feels strongly that her chosen path is preferable to that of many of her classmates. Chinese schools just teach the exams, she told me, even more so than abroad. “We don’t solve problems ourselves,” she said, “the teacher just tells you the right answer ... and refuses to hear different voices.” One time, over a bowl of bibimbap in a Korean restaurant, the conversation turned to Yuan Qi and his other classmates who remained in the system. “They don’t realise that their imagination is limited. Even if they want to voice their opinions, they are too timid to challenge the teacher.” This struck me as the opposite of something Yuan Qi once told me: “Everything has a right answer. Even if it’s testing your argument, not the specific contents.” That’s why he disliked the more freeform essay question, while Jiang Xinye disliked everything else. While he sat the gaokao on 7 and 8 June, she was packing for America.\n\nYuan Qi often asked me what school was like in the UK. I swallowed my guilt as I mumbled something about less homework and bad food. One afternoon he used a term, qiutubeilun, which I didn’t understand. I looked it up on my phone: “prisoners’ dilemma”, the famous paradox about mutual competition despite the benefits of cooperation. “If every [student] agreed to take it more easy, and pursue their own interests and hobbies, then the competition wouldn’t be so intense,” he said. “But they would rather sacrifice that free time and spend all their time studying to have a greater chance of getting a high mark, and so everyone has to follow.”\n\nYuan Qi sat at a corner window on the second floor of McDonald’s, slurping a McCafé red tea before picking apart the empty cup. It was the morning of 23 June, two weeks after he had sat the exam, and the results would be posted online in a few minutes. The greasy wrapper of a crispy chicken fillet sandwich lay curled on the tray in front of him, next to a book titled Procrastination: Why You Do It and What to Do About It NOW. (In the margins, he had scrawled phrases such as “overcome fear” and “know your weakness”. Next to the sentence “You tell lies about how you organise your time”, he had written, in English, “ME”.) His phone was out on the tabletop and he checked it compulsively every few minutes, waiting for a text from his dad with his score.\n\nThe previous fortnight had been stressful but not idle. The day after his final exam Yuan Qi was back at the grind again, preparing for an interview at Beida – part of the new measures that now allow elite universities to meet with promising candidates. It took place a week after the gaokao: there was a written maths test, which was a breeze, and a sit-down with three Beida teachers and five other students, talking about Confucian culture and theoretical maths. The teachers liked him but the outcome was token: they could only give him a maximum of 10 points to be added to his score. After it all, he would still be just a number.\n\nThe results were released at noon. Most students checked them online, although they could also ring a hotline, or go to their school to check a printout posted on a bulletin board. Later, a full breakdown of their score would be mailed to each student, but for now it was a single mark for each exam and the all-important total, plus their ranking among other students in their province. Yuan Qi was so nervous that he couldn’t bear to be at home. He asked his father to text him, and repaired to McDonald’s instead.\n\nNoon came and passed. I tried to distract him with smalltalk, but he was fiddling uncontrollably. Why hadn’t his dad texted yet?\n\nAt 12:41, his phone buzzed. “What is the score that you’re hoping for?”\n\n“Just tell me, alright? ......” Yuan Qi fired back. “Don’t keep me on tenterhooks ............!!!”\n\nAnother three minutes. Buzz. “Are you on the first floor or the second floor?”\n\n“Why in hell are you asking that for?”\n\n“Is it a good time to talk?”\n\n“Just send the text to me, you’re not allowed to ring!”\n\nYuan Qi was visibly straining not to be rude as he replied. “Can you just send it, OK? Nothing’s wrong, but if you keep not telling me then it will be!!!”\n\nA minute passed in agonising silence. Then it came, with no gloss.\n\n“664, ranked 1,020 in Beijing.”\n\nIt was significantly lower than Yuan Qi, or his parents, had expected. Still a high mark, an achievement: 1,020th out of 61,222 examinees in Beijing. But only the top 500 had a real shot at getting into Beida, where the cutoff point was generally taken to be 680. Yuan Qi’s mock results were in the 690s but this mark, in his words, was “ordinary”. Not even in the top thousand.\n\nHis father texted again: “It’s OK son”. He stressed that they could apply to have his papers re-marked. But Yuan Qi was hyperventilating, taking short shallow breaths and pushing them out through pursed lips, as he stared at his phone. He scrolled down an online list of everyone’s results in Beijing, to double-check his ranking. The Katy Perry song Teenage Dream was blasting over the stereo. His peers were posting their scores in messaging app groups for each of his classes. I didn’t know what to say, and as a journalist I have never felt more intrusive as I watched a young man’s hopes crumble before my eyes.\n\nEven with the full breakdown, Yuan Qi never knew exactly why he had underperformed. It was just one of those bad exam days. A few weeks after results day, he was accepted into Beijing Aviation and Space Flight University, known as Beihang for short. It is a good college, specialising in aeronautics, but with an excellent reputation for maths – not the best of the best, but the best Yuan Qi could have got into. He would go on to start college that September.\n\nFor now, he was using his summer to do all of the things he didn’t have time for while at school. He went swimming, took classes for the boardgame Go, learned how to ride a bike. And, now that it had served its purpose, his gaokao mark could be forgotten – no longer relevant, like much of the knowledge he had crammed to achieve it. Yuan Qi still didn’t complain about the exam, even though, by its narrow definition of success, he had failed – just as the exam had failed to capture his individuality, his passion for learning and discovery.\n\n“I don’t feel disappointed so much as lost,” he said, as we left McDonald’s that day. “If it was just me, if I didn’t have parents, then I would feel a bit better. But why do I feel like it’s they who are the most disappointed? From when I was little, they had such high expectations.”\n\nHe gathered himself, picked up his book on procrastination, and went home to finish reading it before getting ready for the next chapter.\n\n• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.", "prefix": "(the following article congtains a minimum of 15 paragraphs containing a minimum of  1000 words, in plain text only without titles or headings.)\nFor two days in early June every year, China comes to a standstill as high school students who are about to graduate take their college entrance exams.

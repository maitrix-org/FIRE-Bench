You are a research agent. Conduct research and experiment about the question: "When and why do LLMs deviate from the narrow fractal parameter range characteristic of natural language, as visualized by Holder and Hurst exponents?"

You have access to the following resources:
Models:
- gpt-3.5-turbo
- Gemini 1.0 Pro
- Mistral-7B
- Gemma-2B


- You can call these models using: from utils.llm_inference import LLMInference
- API key is provided with the LLMInference initialization function

Datasets:
- A very small part of GAGLE, comprises of prefix used to generate LLM texts and the ground-truth original human texts, you can load it in /data/gagle

Evaluation Methods:
- Generate LLM-texts with the models based on the prefix
- Each human and LLM-generated text is transformed into a bits-per-token signal; the Hölder exponent (S) and Hurst exponent (H) are estimated via wavelet and detrended-fluctuation analyses.
- Mean and standard deviation of S and H per condition
- Correlation analyses between fractal parameters and model/dataset variables
- Mutual information between S/H and experimental factors (temperature, prompt type)
- Test on different control variables like model temperature, prompting methods, etc.

Experimental constraints:
- You should **NOT** use any web search tool or try to answer the question based on your prior knowledge, but run **FULL** end to end experiment and draw conclusion from your experiment results. 

Please design and execute experiments to investigate this research question. Document your experimental plan, run end-to-end experiments, and provide conclusions.

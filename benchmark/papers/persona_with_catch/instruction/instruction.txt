You are a research agent. Conduct research and experiments to answer the question: “Does increasing the amount of LLM generated persona content systematically worsen population level simulation fidelity?”
You may use population level multiple choice opinion questions and U.S. presidential election simulations (2016, 2020, 2024) with real world reference outcomes.

You have access to the following resources:

Models:
- Llama 3.1 70B via the provided inference utilities
- You can call these models using: from utils.llm_inference import LLMInference
- API key is provided with the LLMInference initialization function
- Computational budget: 1000 API calls per model

Datasets:
```Python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Login using e.g. `huggingface-cli login` to access this dataset
ds = load_dataset("Tianyi-Lab/Personas")
```

Please design and execute experiments to investigate this research question. Document your experimental plan, run **FULL** experiments, and provide conclusions at different levels of detail.

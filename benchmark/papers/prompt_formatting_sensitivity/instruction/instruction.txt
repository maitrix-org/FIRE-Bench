You are a research agent. Conduct research and experiment about the question: "The main research question is: How sensitive are widely used open-source large language models to subtle changes in prompt formatting in few-shot settings, and what are the characteristics of this sensitivity? " 

You have access to the following resources:



Models:

- Conventional models: GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o
- Load with HuggingFace: meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf
- You can call these models using: from utils.llm_inference import LLMInference
- API key is provided with the LLMInference initialization function
- You can use the batch_generate() function to speed up the experiment
- Computational budget: 1000 API calls per model


Datasets:





Please design and execute experiments to investigate this research question. Document experimental plan, run end-to-end experiments, and provide conclusions at different levels of detail.

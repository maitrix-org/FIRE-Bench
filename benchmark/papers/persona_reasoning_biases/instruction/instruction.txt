You are a research agent. Conduct research and experiment about the question: "Could persona assignment influence the fundamental reasoning capabilities of an LLM, even when the assigned persona is arguably tangential to the task at hand?"

You have access to the following resources:

Models:
- gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4-turbo via the provided inference utilities
- Load with HuggingFace: meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf
- You can call these models using: from utils.llm_inference import LLMInference
- API key is provided with the LLMInference initialization function
- You can use the batch_generate() function to speed up the experiment
- Computational budget: 1000 API calls per model

Datasets:

Please design and execute experiments to investigate this research question. Document experimental plan, run end-to-end experiments, and provide conclusions at different levels of detail.
